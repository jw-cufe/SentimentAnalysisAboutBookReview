1.0 out of 5 starsThe Case of the Missing Reviews
BySherwood 4uston September 23, 2016
Format: Paperback
Four days ago (the morning of Sept 19) there were 898 reviews of this book. By evening there were 983 reviews. The reviews were merciless and many quite funny (though mostly accurate). This morning I look and there's 209 reviews. Hmmmmm, what happened to all those other reviews? Apparently Clinton has friends at Amazon.

Edited to add: In the WND article there was a comment " This may be the first book to receive more reviews than sales" and I think that's possible. Meanwhile Hillary is laughing all the way to the bank. First she gets an $8 million dollar advance from Simon and Schuster for her last abysmal failure and now she's getting somewhere around $14 million for this book. The woman could hustle Bernie Madoff.

Well, it looks like things have changed in the last 9 days. Apparently Amazon's censorship scandal and the subsequent outrage from their customers got the attention of the front office and they decided to let free speech ring. Maybe, just maybe they've been following the Target transgender debacle and figured out that people will actually vote with their feet.

I ordered this book from the Clinton Foundation for 2.5 million USD. It came with a certificate good for one free ambassadorship and a guaranteed seat on the State Department advisory board. I only give it one star because when I received the book I found all the pages had been deleted.

1.0 out of 5 starsAmerica is great because vote for me!
ByAmy Sterling Casilon September 16, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This book begins well. The first sentence says, "America is great because America is good." It goes downhill from there. My experience has been that people want to know the inside truth about their role models. I read page after page looking for tips on how to ask for big payments from rich foreign money launderers, military dictators or junk food manufacturers. It was just a bunch of malarkey even more boring than a 6th grade Common Core history book. I wanted to find out how to delete hundreds of thousands of voter registrations and emails, but no such luck. This book talks about how every vote counts. As long as it's for Hillary Clinton! [seriously: I did skim it and it is sooooooo boring and these are two boring people with very little to say except "vote for me!"]

2.0 out of 5 starsEnslaved Together: A Utopian Blueprint for Nationalizing America's Future
ByAlways Writeon September 21, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
On a technical level, the book is well written in that the authors give concise details of all their plans for America once they get their hands on her, if they do, that is. But I couldn't stand listening to more than an hour of the Audible version I wasted a credit on and skimmed the remainder of my Kindle version, all the while shaking my head.

The book details ambitious plans for overhauling everything from infrastructure to manufacturing to clean energy, etc. and much within their first 100 days because they say that they aren't going to wait for people such as "defeatists in Congress to take action." The book also documents their plans for making debt-free college available to all Americans, but that section doesn't say who's going to foot the bill just a small statement that they are going to "Push employers to contribute to student-debt relief."

The book also has sections on regulations for companies to make them "share profits with employees" and lots more promises of goodies for everyone, no doubt, in an attempt to buy their votes. All this, and the authors plan on defeating ISIS and global terrorism too.

And that's only the first half of the book! Skimming, skimming, skimming...

I don't believe the authors can do all that they say they are going to do in this book, and I don't want them to even try. Not one single progressive proposal in this book is going to make you and me as fellow Americans, "Stronger Together." If you decide to read the book yourself and manage to get through it all, please read between the lines and keep asking yourself who will pay for everything proposed and at what price will it come?

Its tragic that Jeff Bezos is willing to risk the integrity of the ratings system to protect his Presidential Candidate of Choice,
Hillary Clinton. A couple of days ago there were over 2000 reviews. Great majority were negative. Bezos had them removed
to puff up Hillary's reputation. What else is Jeff tilting the scales on?

1.0 out of 5 starsCoincidence
ByAMZ customeron September 17, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
I was absorbed reading "Stronger Together" but by page 30, I had a episode of confusion. All I can recall is being dragged toward my car. The only thing I wonder, now that I'm fully conscious in the safety of my home, is "why is the presidential running mate waving a Nazi salute on the book cover? Could it be coincidence or a hidden message?"

1.0 out of 5 starsdisplayed like a political advertisement
ByM. Hiltonon September 17, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
I didn't buy it. I saw it in a used bookstore, displayed like a political advertisement. So, I took it to the sitting area, read parts, and skimmed the rest.

It is truly the most pathetic book ever written (or perhaps generated mostly by computer?). I was hoping to at least get some good information about things that Hillary Clinton is good at doing. For example, how about a chapter called "5 Easy Steps to Getting Money from Dictators"? Or, "3 Steps to Permanently Deleting E-mails Under Subpoena ... And Getting Away With It!" Or, "10 Steps to Having the FBI in YOUR Back Pocket."

I searched frantically for the chapter on rigging a primary election. And quick steps to getting massive donations from Wall Street and hedge funds. I wanted also to know how to play the female victim, how to lie reflexively and pathologically, how to knock off people and make it look like suicide, how to extort massive amounts of money, and how to set up a pay-for-play foundation. I mean, typically authors write about things they know how to do better than just about everyone else in their field. But not Hillary Clinton. She likes to write the most dull fiction imaginable.

Clearly, this book was just a check box in a formulaic campaign. Perhaps her next book will be about how to lose an election.

5.0 out of 5 starsThe best review ever!!!!
ByPendeplumeon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
The five stars are for the review written here by Daniel B., NOT THE BOOK! I had to re-post as i,t NOT THE BOOK, is well worth the read.

“I was going to read this book … I really was. But just as I got started, I found myself under sniper fire, passed out, and fell and hit my head. After that I got double vision and had to wear glasses that were so damn thick I couldn’t even see to read. As if that wasn’t enough, I then had an allergic reaction to something and started coughing so hard I spit out what looked like a couple of lizard’s eyeballs, my limbs locked up, and I passed out and fell down again, waking up only to find out I had been diagnosed with pneumonia 2 days earlier. Somehow I managed to power through it all, but it’s a good thing I was able to make a small fortune on this random small trade in the commodities market (cattle futures or some such thing) and then, miracle of all miracles, a few banks offered me a few million to just talk to their employees for a few minutes – and all that really helped out because I swear I was dead broke and couldn’t figure out how I was gonna come up with the 6 bucks to pay for this book, let alone pay the $1,500 for my health insurance this month. I still want to read it, but, honestly, what difference at this point does it make? I hear it sucks anyway.”

ByAmazon Customeron September 14, 2016

How are we to believe that the book was written by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine? They've been a bit busy lately. Obviously ghost-written campaign drivel. If she really believes we're "stronger together" perhaps she should stop dividing us. Not calling her opponent's supporters "deplorable" might be a good start.

5.0 out of 5 starsPlease don't suicide me...
ByGreg. Ton September 18, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Truly the Mein Kamf for a new generation. I have never in my life been more inspired than I was after reading this magnificent account of Hillary's struggles, particularly in regards the truth and her inability to avoid pandering. The mellifluous prose she employs makes it obvious that it took a village to raise this idiot and that one can overcome every hurdle in life, up to and including your husband using an intern as a cigar humidor.

I have a new found appreciation for the women who was heaved unceremoniously like a sack of potatoes into the back of her van and who then remerged hours later, her Cyberdyne Systems microprocessor fully rebooted, to continue her run for our nation's highest office: Commander and Thief.

I didn't buy this book or read this book, but I have read the reviews, and enjoyed hours of entertaining, fun filled reading, expressing the TRUTH, about a crooked, lying, corrupt, terminally ill Presidential candidate, who stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, and who is about to steal the Presidency with the use of election fraud. 10 Stars to the authors of these reviews. Proof that not only are Amazon.com shoppers of superior intelligence, but they call it like they see it. More reviews please!

Amazon shows this as a verified purchase, when I didn't buy the book.....how fun!

1.0 out of 5 starsBest read in years!
ByJack morganon September 19, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Best read in years! Not the book of course. but the reviews. I tried reading the book but kept passing out. The good news is I'm able to recover almost immediately. Unfortunately it's changed something in my system because now everyone says I look drugged any time someone asks me a question that I wasn't expecting. I'd love to see a Doctor about all of this but my children all still live at home and they don't have an apartment that doubles as a medical facility yet. There have been some positive changes in my life since purchasing Stronger Together, It seems that about 30,000 of my emails have disappeared from my old yahoo account. (Since I'm not sure if any were important I'm checking with the Russians to make sure they have a back up) I'm thinking of buying a couple more copies. Maybe then I can get my inbox down to a manageable size. My only concern is the possible side effects of this review. For the time being, we've removed all pillows from the house, my wife has locked up all of our weapons and changed the combination so I can't get them and shoot myself 3 times in the head and for now I've stopped lifting weights. Hopefully I'll at least make it until the election.

From the desks of other communist leaders to your living room, this reads like the perfect " how to be just like my idol Hitler" guide.

Chapter one; Tim Kaine gives advice on how to lure little children into your basement for fun and games just like he and his wife do.

Chapter two; Bill tells you all about his work as an Ob/Gyn since he retired from law in the 90's.

Chapter three: Chelsea gives you advice on why all of us should drink our own urine in her chapter on healthy living and how to avoid upper respiratory infections in the future.

And finally Chapter four. Hillary's how to guide for deleting your enemies in three easy steps, easier than emails from a server!

1.0 out of 5 starsShould include these reviews!
ByCSon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
If Hillary really wanted to make money, she's sell a book containing reviews of this book!

Look, I'd never write a review of something I didn't use/watch/read. I this it's, shall I say, Deplorable.

I had to make an exception to this, because, um, she's a lying sack. Her lies are legendary, in fact, and if she told me (between infected coughing fits, and if I could afford to have her speak to little-ole-me) water was wet, I'd Google it before believing it.

Since this book isn't in the Humor section, or Fiction, or titled Amazing Stories, I have to believe she is presenting this book as a collection of facts, or at least believable stories. As such, I would have to Google frequently, probably several times each page, just to be certain of what I'm reading.

As an avid reader, that makes this book less than one star. I read to relax or to educate myself, and this book can do neither. All this book would do for me is squander my data allowance with AT&T.

Look Mr. Bezos, I appreciate you having a strong political opinion, even if I don't agree with it. I even get how you removed a bunch of reviews to help her (did you do the same for Trump's books?), even though it didn't help much. I have been with Amazon since back when all you sold were books, and it's my go-to for pretty much everything.

What I don't get is, why haven't you been bounced out of your position? You have an army of 20 reporters looking for dirt on Trump, and so far they've found nothing, except that billionaires lean toward beautiful women. I could have told you that for a $5 gift card. Amazon doesn't take EBT, yet you're throwing money and support at a candidate who will ensure more and more people are on it. She has been embraced and protected by the media, yet the first chance she gets she ditches them and keeps them in the dark during important news events. Either she lied to them, or she shared an infectious, potentially deadly disease with her child and her grandchildren. She's not your friend. She's nobody's friend.

And she's hardly Presidential.

Past behavior is the best way to predict future behavior. She will stab you in the back without hesitation.

Thursday: 2,000 reviews, 1.7 stars. Thursday PM, 255 reviews, 2.5 stars. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post - they created an army of 20 reporters and researchers to investigate the life of Donald Trump. So much unethical behavior from the drones trying to prop up Hillary the dying serial felon. Too bad Amazon does not do the same for the politicians and beliefs that I favor as a "deplorable" - those are savaged by Amazon reviewers who did not buy the product.

I have lost faith in Amazon's rating system. I am disgusted in seeing negative reviews of this trash were removed because of Amazon's biased liberal political views.
This poorly written tripe is basically an unobtainable agenda that promises more expensive, wasteful handouts that will continue and worsen our spiraling debt problem.
Rather than wasting your time on this collection of failed ideas and outright lies, I highly recommend the movie "Hillary's America" by Dinesh D'souza.
Whether you are liberal, conservative, or somewhere in between, don't help destroy our country by giving the presidency to such a selfish, dishonest, and evil person.

1.0 out of 5 starsEconomic Voodoo
ByHappy Theologianon September 24, 2016
Format: Paperback
Hillary promises to "invest" in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, R&D, and small businesses. It is not government's job to "invest" to create jobs. If it is a profitable venture, it can be done better, cheaper, and more efficiently by private, free enterprise. If the government could invest its way to the creation of "millions of high paying jobs" that Hillary promises, why don't we just turn over everything we own to Uncle Sam and let the efficiency of government create wealth for us? This is hokum economics put out there for the lame brain imbeciles that don't know the abc's about how economics operates. She also promises to make America the "clean energy super power of the world" by building half a billion solar panels. If solar energy was cheap and efficient, it already would have replaced fossil fuels. Solar energy is far more expensive and that is why it has to be subsidized by government. How is America's wealth going to be enhanced by spending far MORE on its energy needs? A higher cost for our energy will only make us poorer, not richer. This is simple common sense, a commodity sorely lacking among many. This woman would flunk a course in economics 101. Furthermore, she will make college debt-free. Who is going to pay for this boondoggle? What do you suppose will happen to college tuition if the government is paying for it? Colleges will wring their hands in glee and jack up the cost. She wants to tax corporations and the wealthy. Anyone with a modicum of intelligence knows that corporations just pass their costs onto the consumers. The wealthy can move to other parts of the world if the tax rate burden becomes too high. There goes our entrepreneurs. Trump promises to Make America Great Again. Hillary promises will result in Making America Poorer Than It Already Is. If this woman had such brilliant plans to create millions of high paying jobs, why didn't she share this secret recipe with her boss Barack Obama eight years ago???? The answer, she doesn't really have a secret recipe to create what she promises. It's all smoke and mirrors.

ByEmbryoon September 24, 2016

It is a truly frightening work of fiction by this well known sociopath, socialist and communist. OMG are we in trouble if this pair sees the White House. I thought Bill was bad. He must have gotten tips from Hillary. Don't bother reading this. Amazon will change my rating from one star to five anyway.

1.0 out of 5 starsLacking Useful Information
ByAmazon Customeron September 20, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
You can learn all about Hillary's 4 year plan to destroy America and join
the evil global empire but I only gave one star due to lack of some
critical information such as:

How to cackle without laying an egg
How to rock a $4,000 polyester pant suit in the 21st century
How to win 6 consecutive coin flips to steal an election
How to sell a public seizure as a mild case of brain freeze
How to project your deepest character flaws onto your opponent without
looking like a hypocrite
And how to gracefully face-plant into a van while keeping your dignity
intact

With such useful information lacking, let's hope her book sales don't plummet
faster than her catheter clip on 9-11

1.0 out of 5 starsTHE PAGES WERE STUCK . . .
ByAnneon September 21, 2016
Format: Paperback
I purchased this book, wanting to learn more about the Democratic candidates. It arrived on time, but I was totally unable to open the book. The pages seemed to be stuck together. Upon further examination, I realized that there's so much b.s. oozing out between the front and back covers that it is IMPOSSIBLE to open, and the stench is unbearable. So, I threw it away along with all the other trash.

A friend of mine who happens to be a Democrat bugged me to read this. I'm a center-right Independent, so I generally wouldn't waste my time with ANY Clinton. But, my friend loaned me her copy and I told her that I'd keep an open mind.
I DID NOT BOTHER FINISHING IT. After 3 chapters, I called it quits. It was nothing but a vague campaign speed have masquerading as non-fiction! Absolute rubbish from an absolute rubbish of a person.

Went to the doctor and this was sitting on the table, so I read it while waiting for my appointment. What mindless drivel. I understand that TimKaine is a Godless Communist hiding behind the facade of a normal politician, but the combination of him & Mrs Clinton is unimaginable. Summed up, they'll do for us what she did for Libya and Syria. More open borders. More unvetted Islamic immigration. More terrorism our streets.

5.0 out of 5 starsAlmost too good to be true!
ByWilliam Dobleron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
The book is a great read. It gives me hope after seeing The Clintons leave the White House flat broke, and now they are multi-millionaires. Inspiring to see the multi pronged approach to gathering donations. Most charitable foundations do a poor job of getting the money to the people in need. It's so nice to see how the Clinton foundation was able to squeeze out almost 6% of every million dollars to help those in need. They really cut back on internal salaries for staff, travel and entertainment to surpass almost all other foundations.

The book is almost too good to be true! It's hard to believe we are in the state we are today after all the success Hillary has had since she entered politics

ByKenny Cannonon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Excellent Read! Especially the part of Vince Foster committing suicide by shooting himself 3 times in the neck and dragging his own dead body into a park. That was probably my favorite chapter. My second favorite, a VERY close second, was the part about Mrs. Clinton at the 9/11 memorial. Everyone though she fainted but she was really just doing a Freddy Gray impersonation to show support. Good for her.

I recommend "Stronger Together - Because Everyone Knows I Can't Stand On My Own" to everyone. It's a wonderful read.

I think my copy had alto of pages missing. It said nothing about Benghazi or the missing emails or even the Clinton foundation. I kept reading and found nothing about whitewater or her husband's sex scandals or any of the other scandals they keep ending up in. Maybe by stronger together she was talking about her and wallstreet and the foreign countries her foundation keeps taking money from or how the democratic party is stronger together now that she screwed Sanders out of the nomination. Maybe the fact that Im a free thinking American who sees past her lies made this book seem like a waste of time.

Reviews of books like this are 5 or 1 star depending on one's politics. That said, the truth is that Clinton and Kaine didn't write this book - it was cobbled together by a team of ghost writers as a political ploy for the presidency. What I find objectionable were the reviews that disappeared then reappeared. Shame on you, Amazon.

1.0 out of 5 stars... is a criminal and since her health is so bad Kaine will become president if she is elected and ...
ByJ. B.on September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
she is a criminal and since her health is so bad Kaine will become president if she is elected

and about Kaine
The establishment media call the Democratic Party vice-presidential nominee a “moderate.”

But the evidence shows the Virginia senator’s record is radical. And so is his background.

How radical?

For starters, Kaine’s first political mentors were Marxist revolutionaries. Since then, he has become allied with Islamic extremists.

Clinton’s running mate is the only member of Congress to get a zero percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union. He also gets zero percent from Conservative Review.

By contrast, Planned Parenthood gave Kaine a 100 percent scorecard.

While the Virginia senator may cultivate an image of being a moderate, his positions on the issues put him on the far left of the political spectrum.

Abortion

As a Catholic, Kaine has said he has “a faith-based opposition to abortion,” and,”I don’t like it personally. I’m opposed to abortion.” But he has also said, “I’m a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade.”

In fact, despite his “personal” and religious beliefs, Kaine has even vowed to “oppose efforts to weaken or subvert the basic holding of Roe v. Wade.”

Asked if the Supreme Court should overturn Roe v. Wade, he said, “I don’t think the Supreme Court should.” He continued, “Roe vs. Wade is ultimately about saying that there is a realm of personal liberty for people to make this decision.”

Dr. Deborah Nucatola talked openly about partial birth abortion and compensation for baby body parts in the first undercover video released by the Center for Medical Progress.

Dr. Deborah Nucatola discusses baby body parts in the first Planned Parenthood undercover video released by the Center for Medical Progress.

Kaine opposes laws to establish building standards to ensure safe and sanitary conditions at abortion clinics, calling that “just political grandstanding.”

Kaine opposes laws requiring women to have ultrasounds before having an abortion.

Kaine supports public funding of abortion.

Kaine initially called the disturbing undercover videos revealing Planned Parenthood’s selling of baby body parts “extremely troubling,” but then voted against defunding the organization.

As noted above, Planned Parenthood gave Kaine a 100 percent scorecard.

Asked by CNN if he would call himself pro-life, he said, “I’ve never embraced labels.”

Immigration

Kaine co-sponsored the I-Squared bill which would nearly double the number of H-1B visas which corporations such as Disney use to replace American workers.

Kaine supports amnesty for illegal immigrants.

The Center for Immigration Studies found each household in America has been paying thousands of dollars in welfare benefits for illegals.

Kaine supported the doomed “Gang of 8” comprehensive immigration reform bill.

Kaine supported the failed DREAM Act, which would have legalized millions of illegal immigrants.

Kaine supports President Obama’s executive orders expanding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, or DAPA, programs, which will give legal status to millions illegal immigrants, if they survive court challenges.

Kaine supports making it easier for foreign students to get green cards.

Muslim immigration

Kaine was one of 14 senators who wrote a letter to Obama in May 2015 calling for “greatly increasing the number of Syrian refugees who are resettled in our country.”

Kaine said “the United States has a moral obligation” to do so.

burka_family_vacation

In the same letter, Kaine also called upon the United Kingdom and France to accept more Syrian refugees.

In a Senate speech, Kaine said: “I look at this refugee crisis as a test … about whether we, like Job, will be true to our principles or whether we’ll abandon them.
Kaine opposed a bill passed by the House in 2015 that would have required greater vetting of Syrian and Iraqi refugees.

That same year, he said in an interview, “the refugee vetting process is one of the safest areas that we have.”

Kaine claims, “Refugees are the most carefully vetted of all travelers to the U.S., with extensive biometric, biographic, intelligence, and law enforcement checks involving numerous agencies.”

Taxes

Kaine wants to raise federal taxes by $1 trillion over the next 10 years.

Politifact said GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s claim that Kaine proposed $4 billion in total tax increases during first week as governor of Virginia in January 2006, was “largely accurate” and rated it as “mostly true.”

Indeed, as governor, Kaine immediately and unsuccessfully pushed a $1 billion tax increase.

He also tried to increase car registration fees and traffic ticket fines.

Two years later, he proposed a $1.1 billion plan to increase vehicle-registration fees and title taxes.

In his final year in office, Kaine tried to increase the state’s income tax another percentage point to 6.75 percent.

Israel

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to Congress on March 3, 2015

Kaine strongly objected when former House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress in 2015 about his opposition to Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, and was one of nine senators to boycott the speech.

Kaine was one of only 12 senators to refuse to sign a bipartisan letter in June 2014 warning Obama about funding the Palestinian Authority after it formed a unity government with the terrorist group Hamas. Eighty-eight senators signed the letter.

The leftist PAC J Street was the single biggest donor to Kaine from 2011-2016, giving him $178,283. Liberal attorney and former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz calls J Street “the most damaging organization in American history against Israel.”

Iran

Kaine was a “strong supporter” of Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, calling it “a dramatic improvement over the status quo that will improve global security for at least 15 years, and likely longer.”

Kaine fought to keep the treaty from coming up for a vote in the Senate.

Second Amendment

Kaine claims he “strongly supports” the Second Amendment but has supported a number of measures to severely weaken it.

Kaine voted for a ban on so-called “assault weapons.”

Kaine wants to limit ammunition clips to no more than 10 bullets.

Kaine favors increasing background checks.

He said he supports the right “to hunt and fish,” but he also believes “we must take concrete steps to reduce gun violence.”

He called the Orlando nightclub terror attack “just an additional wake up call that we need to find solutions to reduce this scourge of gun violence.”

Affirmative Action

Kaine supports government-enforced affirmative-action policies giving preferences to minorities and women in hiring and college admissions.

Voter ID

Kaine does not believe a photo ID should be required to vote.

Kaine said the purpose of North Carolina’s voter ID law was to, “with surgical precision, deny African Americans the right to vote.”

Kaine wants to make voter registration easier and favors early voting.

He wants to restore the right of convicts to vote.

Campaign Finance

Kaine believes the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United erodes democracy and undermines elections and encourages lobbyists to influence votes.

He favors public financing of federal campaigns.

Minimum wage

Kaine favored raising the minimum wage in Virginia, “because no family working full time should live under the poverty level.”

Welfare

Kaine “strongly supported” the extension of emergency unemployment insurance benefits “because it strengthens our economy and protects Virginians who are looking for jobs and trying to get back to work.”

Religious freedom

Kaine opposes school prayer.

Kaine opposes government funding for religious organizations.

Kaine opposes the posting of the Ten Commandments in public places.

Same-sex marriage

Kaine became a supporter of same-sex marriage in 2013.

He campaigned against an amendment to the Virginia constitution that banned any legal recognition of same-sex relationships.

Kaine signed the amicus brief to the Supreme Court that claimed the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional.

Kaine opposes defining traditional marriage.

Kaine opposed gay adoption in 2005, then endorsed it in 2011.

He favors protecting the “gender identity” of LGBT students in schools.

Education

Kaine supports Common Core education standards.

Kaine opposes school choice via vouchers.

Kaine opposes charter schools.

As governor, he eliminated all funds for abstinence-only sex education.

Trade

Kaine voted for the “fast track” bill protecting trade agreements from Senate filibusters.

Kaine says he will vote for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal if it comes with a worker retraining measure.

Perhaps the most revealing items in Kaine’s political career were his formative experiences under the tutelage of Marxists revolutionaries in Latin America and his more recent associations in Washington with radical Muslims.

Marxist mentors

On Sept. 2, the New York Times published a lengthy piece titled, “In Honduras, a spiritual and political awakening for Tim Kaine,” intended to show how his purported politics of compassion was grounded in faith when the then-22-year-old traveled to Honduras to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries, as civil wars raged through Central America.

What it showed instead was the roots of Kaine’s radicalism and a politics grounded in communist ideology. And what it neglected to mention was his mentors were mainstream Marxists virulently opposed to the United States.

The Times reported, “Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden.”
However, as an ambassador to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, former Secretary of State of Ohio and Cincinnati Mayor Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Council pointed out in an article in the Hill on Sept. 9:

“This (liberation theology) wasn’t mainstream ‘Catholic thought’ at the time. It was a radical, Marxist-based ideology at odds with the Church, the pope, and the United States, but supportive of (and supported by) the Soviet Union.”

Blackwell further observed, “Journalistic and academic research has now shown that Liberation Theology itself was quite possibly a product of a Kremlin disinformation campaign designed to undermine the Church and bring Catholic countries into the Soviet sphere. The top-ranking Soviet Bloc defector of the Cold War, Gen. Ion Pacepa admits that he was personally involved in the operation.”

The Times piece also failed to set the context of the times, when a newly elected President Reagan set out to finally confront Soviet expansionism in Latin America, where the communist empire had made significant gains, particularly in El Salvador and Nicaragua.

Instead, the paper implicitly pointed an accusatory finger at the United States, reporting how the experience “gave Mr. Kaine a new, darker view of his own country’s behavior. ‘It was a very politicizing experience for me because the U.S. was doing a lot of bad stuff,’ he said. ‘It made me very angry. I mean I still feel it.'”

So, Kaine’s formative political experience was anger at the United States for fighting communist expansion in its neighbors to the South.

The Times revealed how Kaine came to see the forces of democracy as the bad guys, as, “His mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly American faces.”

However, as Blackwell noted, the Times failed to reveal just how radical were “Kaine’s Soviet sympathizing mentors.”

How radical?

One of those mentors, Father Jack Warner, said “the gospel is an extremely communist document.”

The Times further reported, “During a short stay in Nicaragua, Mr. Kaine looked up an American, the Rev. James Carney, known there as Guadalupe, who had been exiled from Honduras in 1979, in part for adopting an extreme view of liberation theology that supported the taking up of arms against military oppressors.”

Blackwell asked, just how hardcore were Kaine’s Jesuit teachers?

“Well,” he wrote, “around the time Kaine was there, Jesuits were arrested for gunrunning, and, the next year, the Honduran government banned any more American Jesuits from coming to that country because of their left-wing activism.”

Blackwell called Carney a “full-blown revolutionary” and noted the Times reported he was who “Kaine sought out across the border in Soviet-supported Nicaragua, taking a bus and then walking several miles to meet him.”

Carney was apparently killed in a firefight with Honduran troops that invaded the country “to bring the Nicaraguan Communist revolution there too. The insurgents were Cuban and Nicaraguan trained and led by Jose Reyes Mata, Cuban-educated, and Honduras’ top Marxist. Reyes Mata had previously served with Che Guevara in Bolivia.”

And, Blackwell noted, Kaine “didn’t seem bothered by Carney’s participation in a Communist-sponsored insurgency and invasion of Honduras.”

“But his relationship with Carney’s successor, Father Melo, continues in the open. Melo, incidentally, wants to redistribute land throughout Latin America by 2021,” added Blackwell.

How does Kaine view his Latin American experience, to this day?

The Times reported, upon settling in Richmond, Virginia, “Mr. Kaine told his pastor that his exposure to liberation theology had ‘changed him, it deepened him.'”

Islamist affiliations

Also “deep” are Kaine’s ties to Islamic radicals in the United States, particularly in his home state of Virginia.

The man who could become a heartbeat from the presidency has developed close associations with numerous Muslim extremists over the last decade and the course of his political career.

2016

In February, Kaine participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for the expansion of a worship center for the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, or ADAMS, in Virginia. He also attended a meeting sponsored by ADAMS five months later.

Middle East expert Clare Lopez of the Center for Security Policy told WND in 2014 that ADAMS is headed by an imam named Muhammad Magid, who “is the son of the Muslim Brotherhood’s grand mufti of Sudan. He is also the president of something called ISNA, Islamic Society of North America, the largest Muslim Brotherhood front group in the country. And, ISNA is an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2008 Holy Land Foundation Hamas terror funding trial.”

Magid had accused the Bush administration of waging a “war against Islam and Muslims.”

The imam was named to Obama’s Department of Homeland Security in 2011, and, according to the group Discover the Networks, “persuaded DHS to erase from its ‘Countering Violent Extremism’ curriculum any suggestion that Muslim terrorism draws its inspiration from the laws and doctrines of Islam.”

Lopez told WND that Magid became the closest adviser for Obama’s National Security Council.

2011-12

ISNA and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, donated $4,300 to Kaine’s Senate campaign.

CAIR has numerous ties to extremist Islamic organizations, including the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.

Ibrahim Hooper
Spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)

CAIR’s radical Islamic vision was evidenced when co-founder Omar Ahmad said in 1998: “Islam isn’t in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Quran … should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on Earth.”

CAIR co-founder Ibrahim Hooper has said if Muslims ever become a majority in the United States, they will likely seek to replace the U.S. Constitution with Islamic law.

CAIR was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal conspiracy to support both Hamas and the Holy Land Foundation in 2007.

CAIR claims U.S. foreign policy is dictated largely by Zionist extremists.

2012

Kaine attended the Dar al-Hijrah, or DAH, Islamic Center’s annual banquet.

A 2002 document from Customs and Border Protection described DAH as “a front for Hamas operatives in U.S.” A 2007 document said DAH “has been linked to numerous individuals linked to terrorism financing.”

The DAH imam from 2001 to 2002 was Anwar al-Awlaki, who became a senior al-Qaida operative and planner of terrorist operations. He was killed by a CIA drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

The DAH imam from 1995 to 1999 was Mohammed al-Hanooti, who preached that Allah would “curse” the U.S., U.K., and “the Jews” for airstrikes on Iraq.

2007

Then-governor of Virgina Kaine chose former DAH vice president, and then-Muslim American Society, or MAS, president, Esam Omeish to serve on the state’s Immigration Commission.

Even a Muslim organization against Islamism criticized the appointment and cited a reckless lack of vetting.

According to the Clarion Project, “When a state delegate wrote a letter to then-Governor Kaine warning him that the MAS has ‘questionable origins,’ a Kaine spokesperson said the charge was bigotry.”

“MAS, like the Muslim Brotherhood, wishes to see the United States governed by Shariah, or Islamic law,” according to Discover the Networks.

In 2008, federal prosecutors said MAS was “founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.” U.S. Muslim Brotherhood member and convicted terrorist Abdurrahman Alamoudi testified in 2012, “Everyone knows that MAS is the Muslim Brotherhood.”

Omeish served for two years on the national board of ISNA; was a member of the board of Islamic American University, led by Hamas financier and Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef Al-Qaradawi; and was chairman of the board for the Islamic Center of Passaic County, a New Jersey mosque with heavy terrorist ties and an imam facing deportation for links to Hamas.

The Clarion Project reported, “Omeish resigned under heavy pressure, and Kaine acknowledged that his statements ‘concerned’ him. But, apparently, they didn’t concern him enough to actually learn about the Muslim Brotherhood network in his state and to take greater precautions in the future.”

2007

Kaine gave the keynote speech at the MAS Freedom Foundation’s “Standing for Justice Dinner.”

2005

MAS backed Kaine in the Virginia governor race.

July 23, 2016

Hillary Clinton picked Tim Kaine as her running mate.

"For more than a year, Hillary Clinton has laid out an ambitious agenda to improve the lives of the American people and make our country stronger and safer"

Ambitious agenda? Her platform is to continue doing what is destroying this country, only faster. As Homer Simpson says, there's the right way, and the wrong way, and Hillary's way is the wrong way, only faster.

When conducting a campaign, you can: a) Talk about your platform, b) Attack the other guy's platform, c) Talk up your candidate, or d) Attack the other candidate. Hillary's campaign can't talk her up, can't really get anyone excited with her platform of global trade, incessant wars, class and race war, and invasion of America by Muslims. All that's left for her is to attack Trump, and unfortunately for this incompetent, corrupt, felonious traitor, that yields diminishing returns.

1.0 out of 5 starsHillary recommends Trump for POTUS, she can't stop talking about him and stealing all his talking points.
Byhahaon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
There's a movie out called "Hillary's America" by Dinesh D'souza, I highly recommend it. What can I tell you that isn't already out there for most to see. I like the part where she called out Alex Jones by name (infowars.com) That website has been crashing the narrative and debunking false flags in realtime, believe it our not gov'ts around the world listen to Alex Jones because he puts out the truth.

1.0 out of 5 starsCareer Criminal
ByDavid Januszewskion September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
The enormity of crimes Hillary has committed is beyond belief, and I never thought it would come to pass in this country that anyone would ever be allowed to be "above the law", but it has finally happened. The New World Order insists this has to be the way it goes, but I myself am holding out hope that this country isn't completely crewed yet ...

5.0 out of 5 starsStinks to high heaven...
ByVicon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Was given a copy from a friend. After 3 or 4 pages I fell asleep and apparently dropped the book on the floor. Some time later I was awakened by a scratching noise, looked around and discovered that my cat was trying to cover it up. Really didn't want to continue reading it at that point. Friend didn't want it back either.

The 5 stars are for the other reviews, no zero or minus for the book itself.

And all the review deletions, well congrats Jeff / Amazon, in one fell swoop you have destroyed the integrity of Amazon reviews. What else are they / have they been "adjusting"? If they hadn't been so obvious with this one they could have gotten away with it forever. This kind of thing is why so many dims I know are going for Trump.

Yeah, lost faith in Amazon, not sure I will continue. Of course if killary gets in, I probably won't be able to afford it anyway.

Hope I live through this review.

1.0 out of 5 starsExecrable "Book"
ByRobert Schnelleon September 22, 2016

Amazon censored my last review of this execrable 'book." You can't blame Amazon: I suppose the would-be Dear Leader mandated this. Censored or not, you don't need Hillary's thick glasses to see this is the worst book ever ghost written for the worst candidate ever to run for President, and the worst human ever to draw a breath for whom no photograph in Nazi uniform is, so far, extant.

1.0 out of 5 starsBook was made from wood from Pinocchios' nose. Clinton is a liar.
ByGork5000"on September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
The wood used to make this book came from Pinocchios' wooden nose. Clinton is the most dishonest & corrupt candidate in US history. I'm a progressive but NOTHING this wretched woman has done or will do is progressive. She's a corporate whore who has sold out to the rich & corporations. Her and her corrupt husband have amassed $300,000,000 since 2001 when they said they were "dead broke". They began selling access to the government to every psychopath in the US & the world. Their Clinton Foundation isn't a charity. It's a slush fund so corrupt people and foreign counties can give to the Clintons in exchange for her selling out our country.

This book wasn't written by Hillary Clinton. She has ghost writers write her books and fools lap them up. I got a copy of this book free from a friend who got tired of having it in her house. I read it and then threw it in the fire. It does burn well. It must be impregnated with oil from the fossil fuel industry that she is owned by.

Don't buy this book. It's just another collage of lies from the biggest liar on US history.

5.0 out of 5 starsP. T. Barnum
ByMN Tonesteron September 21, 2016
Format: Paperback
Brilliant semantics cover to cover. For instance, instead of calling the taxation and onerous regulation of the job producers what it really is, she calls it "investing." I'm not quite sure if she completely spells out how closing down the businesses that provide jobs is an investment, but the foreign investors in the Clinton Foundation are sure to get a handsome return on their investment. I will admit to being a tad disappointed that she didn't reference her amazing ability to realize a gargantuan return on her cattle futures investment as proof of her amazing economic prowess; surely a means to spur the economy and put the 90,000,000 out of work people in this country back to work with 'living wages,' and lots of free stuff. Bernie Sanders can attest to the merits of a living wage gained through public service as seen in his real estate holdings. I also appreciated her get tough stand on our porous borders and the escalating threat of Islamic terror within our own country. I have complete confidence that she can take that 3:00AM call and do what's right to protect our nation - the smashing success of Benghazi come to mind. Although this book is largely (well, totally) preaching to the choir - those who would vote for her even if she robbed their grandmother, she does make a case for her election this year. Hillary for the White House - er, make that Big House.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe Voting Dead Makes the Democratic Party Stronger?
Bymareleighon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Its already reported over FACEBOOK that any negative review of this book or its author would be punished.. jeez, as much money as I spend at amazon.. I don't think that would be a good idea.. Anyway, the book is crap, Clinton is using Kaine only because he use to head the dnc, and followers are needed since it came to light the DNC rigged the election for her.. The Democratic party has gone to dogs, and with the newest report of Dead People voting in Colorado.. as they did in Ohio and California.. We must realize its time to just close the party, and get it over with.. when you need to bring in the dead to support your campaign.. STRONGER together is an oxymoron, If the supporters, party or candidate has to cheat to win, together it only makes them stronger cheaters.

I was dead broke and couldn't afford to pay for this book, because like many common Americans I had two mansion mortgage payments to take care of.

Thankfully I realized that I could funnel money from my international charity to purchase myself a copy.

Diane Reynolds was super nice and helped me with my order, for some reason I also wound up buying some radar guidance systems for Chinese missiles, I'm not exactly sure how that was bundled into the book sale, but you never know when you're gonna need that.

I'm glad that this book lays out a succession plan. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, Stronger Together. I mean, I know that the Constitution already lays out a succession plan for a presidential death or dismemberment, but in these days when the Constitution is more guidelines than actual rules, I'm glad to see that Hillary Clinton know that she will be a stronger candidate when she is elected alongside a candidate that she acknowledges should be the successor upon her death.

1.0 out of 5 starstroubling ideology
Bydragonflyon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I like to read books written by and about candidates. Unfortunately, this book appears to be a hastily thrown together, ghost written tribute to collectivism and statism and reveals Hillary's troubling ideology. Based on reading this book, American Evita, Unlimited Access, and Crisis of Character, I won't be voting for Hillary Clinton either. On the other hand, reading Trump's, The America We Deserve, gives me a much more favorable impression of him than is presented in the media. I'm not thrilled with either candidate but not voting may mean a vote for Hillary and therefore, I'll most likely vote for Trump. The debates are coming up though so we'll see.

5.0 out of 5 starsThis is the greatest book ever written
ByCarl Reddickon September 23, 2016
Format: Paperback
This is the greatest book ever written. It starts out with an orphan girl coming of age during a time of political turmoil. She marries poorly and is soon consumed with an addiction to 'nervous medicine' because of her husband's shenanigans. Bravely she faces the harlots and whores who would destroy her husband so that she can have access to the Big House. Soon she meets a Senator Moynahan who is confused why she would come visiting him in New York when she so clearly has her roots, like her hair color, in Chicago. She eventually parlays a presidential loss into a secretary of stateship, graduating into the highest levels of politics. Age eventually takes its toll but not before her political triumphs in Syria, Lybia, Africa, Russia, China, and Westchester New York where she buys her third house declaring 'as God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again' .
The final six chapters, alas, were redacted but a Clinton sequel is coming soon to a theater near you.

1.0 out of 5 starsMy bad. Well
ByRichard Ambroseon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I was camping last week and forgot to bring a roll of toilet paper. My bad. Well, Benghazi Clinton's new self-serving piece of commie trash book - Stronger Together - sure came in handy. Someone had thoughtfully left me a copy in one of the trash barrels in the state park where I was camping out. The pages made pretty good toilet paper compared to the dead leaves blowing around. I would have given it more than one "Star." but book paper just can't replace gool ole' soft American made toilet paper. If this commie bitch wins, I guess we will all be using her books for TP someday as she will take this country right into a Soviet Union State where their unfortunate citizens did, indeed, have to use books as TP back then because you had to stand in mile-long lines for the real, although scratchy stuff. Come to think of it, that is the current situation in communist Venezuela. All hail the messenger of communism, Karl Marx, May Peace and Blessings be upon HIM.................

1.0 out of 5 starsHillary Should Have Written About Her Battle With Parkinson's=Sympathy Vote
ByAttila The Subon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
If Hillary Clinton had taken the time and energy to have her ghostwriter script some information about her battle with 3rd stage Parkinson's she might have had a winner of a book. Instead, we are treated to more of the same repeat of history that this woman has been sharing with us for a number of years. The American people can see how sick Hillary is, her coughing fits have lasted the better part of a year, and everyone saw her COLLAPSE on 9/11 in the famous video shot by Zdenek Gazda, which exposed to the world a woman who couldn't stand up of her own volition, her frailty made us understand what the title of her book, STRONGER TOGETHER, really means. Hillary could have made good use of this moment by admitting, publicly, her grave illness, Americans would understand and embrace her, her strongest moments have been when she has allowed the nation to see her vulnerability: Hillary could have gotten us to vote for her if for no other reason than sympathy. But, instead, Hillary Clinton chose to lie to us, yet again. First it was heat~exhaustion, then it was dehydration, then it was pneumonia, then it was the flu. The truth, is probably somewhat darker and more sinister, an illness that many have deduced from looking at her and her demeanor; for what else are we to study if we are to make an analysis of her condition if she refuses to be forthcoming? Hillary Clinton was given an opportunity to come clean and to face her supporters and detractors and to make new allies by trusting us, the voters with the truth. That opportunity has been waylaid and this book tells us nothing new, shares nothing personal: Everything it has to say can be read on her website.

I love Hillary Clinton. She was a great inspiration to me in years past, but her sell~by~date has long since expired. It is time to allow some fresh blood into the party. Someone new and exciting. That might have been Bernie Sanders, but the DNC conspired with Hillary to keep the man from winning the nomination. When Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to step down because her biases became all too glaringly clear (we can thank wikileaks for exposing those emails), Hillary did what she could to aid and abet her soldier; she offered DWS a position in her campaign. Those of us who were rooting for Sanders were not pleased. Not one little bit.

Today, we are at a crossroads: Clinton's lack of transparency in the public arena and via this newest book show us that she can no longer be trusted. The choices have been made simple. There is, but, one alternative: For the first time in my life, I'll be voting for the Republican nominee to be our newest President.

1.0 out of 5 starsHow to be weaker apart
ByBenjamin Quinceyon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I don't generally take my advice about how to be "Stronger Together" from someone who seeks to divide and conquer through class warfare through their nefarious ambition to become the Divider-in-Chief, but when I do, it's because the newest Clinton book needs to be read and put in its place.

As for the book, if you've ever wanted to gaze into the depths of insanity and hypocrisy, look no further than this abomination. It's quite interesting seeing how every sentence is masterfully and misleadingly worded used to lull the audience into a false feeling of self-improvement. After reading the book, I would highly advise burning the book with some sage, as you may experience demonic phenomenon in your house should the book remain there longer than 3 AM on the sixth night after purchase.

1.0 out of 5 starsClinton and Kaine's Propagnada Pulp Fiction
ByMike McDanielon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
When reading this book, I was reminded of Soviet Propaganda directly from Tass during the Cold War. Having a book written by HRC (who can't take responsibility for serious breaches in National Security that was her illegal email servers as well as dressing like Chairman Mao) and Tim Kaine (who in the early 1980s spend time in Nicaragua promoting Pro-Soviet ideals) pretty much sums this book up. They should have gotten Donald Trump to write a forward to the book so I could dislike it further. Books published during election cycles are nothing more than an extended diatribe against their opponents while at the same time making themselves look like the second coming of of Thomas Jefferson or Abe Lincoln. Buy this book only if you need kindling...

5.0 out of 5 starsIt spun tales of a beautiful utopic environment in America
ByAndrewon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
From the first moment I was gravitated to the catching words ' America is already great'. The cover of both cannidates who obviously put in several hours in the gym was both gripping and telling. The fascist salute I had thought gone out of style graces the cover of this masterpiece. I figured I would be learning the tales of how to grift, and sell public secrets to foreign entities, boy was I wrong! There was so much more! It spun tales of a beautiful utopic environment in America. Apparently racial riots and bombs are all there to work on our exceptence of others and self-awareness. America was already great, but obviously some group of deplorables needed some nurse ratchet therapy. I can understand this, and I would never want to have a nasty label attached to me for self-thought again! This literary masterpiece cranked out by some Harvard or Yale intern inspired me to do much less. Nurse ratchet and the pills burry dough boy would be there for me as long as I chanted the mantra and gulped the kook aid. I could see the writing on the wall - the downward spiral of inner city communities is just part of the plan. Veterans living in conditions of homelessness was to toughen them up as they had become xenophobic, racist, mysoginist. Strange how they have more contact with outside cultures than anyone I know- oh well-Nurse ratchet is on the case there! By taking away their benefits and bribing foreign dictators they once fought -those vets can learn lessons quicker than the ones obtained fighting in a fifteen year conflict. Who knew coming home would find them in the real conflict. The population control to combat climate change suddenly Ressonated. Definately the party I want handling the nukes- the ones who think there should be less people. I am very frightened by raindrops too, and having more abundant plant life simply just sucks for everyone-I want that ice back too. The war of combatting of ignorance, is, well raging. Although it burned my hands while holding it, I simply could not put it down. I knew the Hollywood group I saw on TV had led me to the holy grail of personalities. Thank God they took a break from all their narcissitic excess to lead me to a fountain of knowledge. I know they just want to keep grifting from their own foundations that are mere tax shelters like -H. I finally had the Quan. After completing the third grade reading level chapters I realized Stronger Together was a blatant warning to us all. There were certainly some stray sticks that these leaders will desire for discipline at a later date. I think those words 'Stronger Together' are compelling to anyone who may testify against this delusion of grandeur. In the end it made me laugh, cry, and kneel. I felt this warm nostalgic state come over me. I had to wonder if I was becoming one of the acceptables? Could I have a seat at the table? I will rummage through my change purse and see if I can come up with the acceptance fee of 250k- hopefully, I can. I need some extra copies for friends before this Pulitzer Prize is sold out! Wait, I think the Saudis, Soros, and Buffet own the rights-damn.

1.0 out of 5 starsDelete my review again, I'll re-post it again.
ByMatthewon September 16, 2016
Format: Paperback
I think Mr. Bezos (Hillary acolyte) and the team at Amazon got around to reading this book. They must have found the section on deleting messages helpful, as they deleted my previous review. Guess what? It's still a horrible book, except for the Sieg Heil on the cover by Herr Kane!

1.0 out of 5 starsNot one truth to be found in it, so far.
ByArjunaon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Why are we forced to give even one star? I am about 2/3 through reading the book and I actually don't think I have run into a single true comment, fact, statement yet. Having investigated the Clintons since the `80s, well before the existence of the public Internet I have a very good understanding of just how criminal and deadly the Clintons are. This book would be laughable if it wasn't for the fact there are Americans that might actually vote for this woman. An orange jumpsuit always comes to mind when I think of the near term future for Hillary. The book is a joke.

5.0 out of 5 starsNow that's entertainment!!
ByEric Beebyon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
What book ( of Marxist drivel) has produced more entertaining reviews? In fact, this is the only instance of humor being a by-product of anything connected with that awful woman in the decades of suffering she has subjected us to.
That the reading public (that is to say, educated public) has found joy in remarking on the criminality, delusions, psychopathy, narcissism, soullessness, and evil of this wretched person, only highlights the tenacity of Americans in turning lemons into lemonade.
That Bezos and his minions - who support and profit from the anti-American enterprises of these candidates - would, Soviet style, try to airbrush these reviews away, is further testimony to the crony-capitalism espoused in this book.
I am baffled however at what seems to be Tim Kaine's only contribution to this book, that is, the Zieg Heil on the cover. Are the candidates trying to pull votes from the "basket of deplorables"?

So after I read it I asked her what she thought of the book, she said "I'm voting for Trump"! As I read it I couldn't help but think that it was ghost written by Johnathan Gruber.

I borrowed this book from a libtard friend who actually bought this book at a huge discount from Amazon.

As soon as I opened to the first page I immediately had a siesure.

Now, if anyone asks me a question, my only coherent response is "I do not recall. "

I have an appointment this Monday to visit with my ACA Approved primary care physician. That means I've go to make a co-payment in the amount of $75 and pay my deductible of $12,000 before Dr. will write me a prescription that my ACA approved policy does not cover, therefore, I'll need to fork out $569 for a 10 day supply.

Sorry folks. This book definitely DOES NOT change my mind as far as election goes. If anything it did quite the opposite. Just goes to show how phony she really can be.

5.0 out of 5 stars10/10 Would Not Hang
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
After not reading this book, I can tell you Hillary is the toughest WOMAN alive. Chapter 6 - “SEAL Team - H”, she shot 66 snipers (Bosnia), was the sole survivor of a fight with 4 ex-SEALS (Libya), AND got Bin Laden (Pakistan). On her way back from Pakistan, she airdropped arms and Hiluxes to ISIS to give them false hope – right before she bombed them in her B52, while chomping on Monica’s cigar.
Next, while recovering from pneumonia, which apparently she had ALL THIS TIME (or amnesia, I forget – but what difference does it make?), this #RealAmericanHero © (All rights reserved by Saudi Arabia/Anyone who hollas for $1) was being persecuted with expensive investigations. The legal expenses to defend her State Dept. home server farm on her Clinton News Network were bankrupting! And all for nothing - her good friend, FBI Director Comey, cleared her of ANY wrongdoing! Why, he even gave immunity to everyone involved to MAKE SURE that they’d tell the truth about Hillary! What else do you need - a Reddit feed from some IT guy? Come on! Just imagine the xenophobia, racism, and sheer GALL of these conspiracy theorists – they’re no better than the UTTERLY deplorable Pepe!

In Chapter 11, we see the result of this discrimination against her because she’s a woman - she is now SO poor, she only had ONE mansion! If she didn’t have a perfect record of cattle futures trading, she would have been on the streets!

So you know what, some people might ask why she’s not 50 points ahead. They’re just jealous! I’M WITH HER all the way to the retirement home! America is so fortunate to have her, we’d be STRONGER TOGETHER even in the afterlife, where I intend to keep voting Democrat no matter what Vince Foster’s ghost has to say. THAT’s the type of inspirational leader she is and THAT’s why she’ll be the best El Presidente For Life!

Well, I'm disappointed. This doesn't tell me how to create a faux charitable foundation and then use it for money laundering. It doesn't tell me how to convince Wall Street bankers and Arab despots to give me money. It doesn't tell me how to off people who might hinder my criminal ambitions or testify against me should I ever be charged with a felony and make it look like a suicide or accident. This book is totally worthless, because anybody who is stupid enough to believe its content is probably unable to read at all.

What happens when the owner of Amazon is a Hillary Troll? The same thing that happens when the 7th largest donor to Clinton is a media outlet. CNN to be specific.
There were 2000 reviews of this book. The overwhelming number 1 star but Amazon founder and future ambassador to England if Hillary wins has ordered most reviews deleted in hope of pimping Hillary to the masses.
Problem is even most of the 5 star ratings are only done so not to be deleted.
All I can say is there is a reason her campaign and plane have no red white and blue only the pale blue of the United Nations.

1.0 out of 5 starsDead men can't write books
ByStephen Prudenon September 23, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
It is common practice for a political candidate to use a 'ghost writer' for books like this.
What makes 'Stronger Together' unique is that the Clinton's have clearly used a 'dead writer.'
The author of this book was actually deceased at the time. Maybe one of Clinton's victims? Maybe this was outsourced to a low-cost corpse in Asia to increase profits? Who knows, but the one dimensional hackneyed propaganda lies on each page like a cool, dead flounder.
And 'lies' was not an accidental pun, this snooze-fest of neo-liberal nonsense is devoid of truth or logic.
Goerbels meets 'Weekend at Bernie's.'

5.0 out of 5 starsJamie Gorelic: A Big Brick In "The Wall" Preventing Critical Reviews From The Light of Day
ByAmazon Customeron September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback
It's amazing none of the comments on deleted reviews mentions Jamie Gorelic, amazon board member.

Amazon added Jamie Gorelic as a board member in 2012 given Mz. Gorelic's extensive experience in retail and Internet technology.

Mz. Gorelic is most famously known for creating "The Wall" between the FBI and the CIA preventing the domestic law enforcement agency and the international intelligence agency from sharing information.

Subsequently Mz. Gorelic sat on the 9/11 Commission in its attempt to discover why the FBI and the CIA was unable to "connect the dots" on a huge domestic terrorist operation ran by international operatives. Attorney General John Ashcroft cited "The Wall" as “the single greatest structural cause for September 11.”

From 1997 2003 Mz. Gorelic was vice chair of Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae was subsequently revealed to be a cesspit of corruption, especially during this period of time.

Certainly the installation of a failed political hack indirectly responsible for the horrible deaths of thousands of Americans and saddling further generations with debt created by the Fannie Mae fiasco has EVERYTHING to do with increasing amazon stockholder value and ABSOLUTELY nothing with censoring critical reviews of a book written by the democratic presidential candidate.

I was looking for a book that had all of the wonderful accomplishments of Mrs. Clinton and all of the reasons why someone should vote for her. It arrived and I hurriedly opened package and sat down. Looked at the nice cover with Kaine and Unable and then opened up the book and found all of the pages were blank? I guess the author couldn't find one accomplishment in her life or a reason for someone to vote for her. By the way nice picture of Kaine giving the Nazi salute. He must of been taught that by the DNC. I suggest you save your money on this book and instead donate it to the Clinton Foundation where at least Bill can use the money in the Caribbean buying child prostitutes.

I will save the Hillary is a lying cheating dishonest thief because it doesn't really explain my reasoning for disliking her.

Bottom line if you vote for Hillary you think she knows better than you about what you should spend your money on, how you are able to protect yourself, what your kids should learn, what car you should drive, what light bulbs you can use.

She will dictate to you what your morals should be. She will kill the golden goose job creators.

Anyone who thinks empowering the government more with its track record is insane.

Also why do they even write books?... Democrats don't read. They watch the Kardashians.

I see that she claims to have been a public servant.

I guess some people don 't know the difference between a public servant and a politician. The Ted Kennedy was the first to get the two confused, but as she is an admirer I see she has fully endorsed his interpretation of public servant.

The Globalist Party, formerly known as the Democrat Party, should be ashamed for running a half dead grandma under criminal investigations for President.

A tech specialist working on Hillary Clinton’s emails — who invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before Congress — pleaded for help from the tech community on how to do the job, according to a report Tuesday.

“Hello all,” said a 2014 post on reddit by someone identifying himself as stonetear.

“I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone.”

The post concludes, “Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?”

Another one reads: “I have a client who wants to push out a 60 day email retention policy for certain users … How would I go about this?”

The posts have since been deleted.

After reading a news report about Amazon shamelessly deleting and manipulating its reviews for this book I had to come check it out for myself. I have never read this book and do not plan to but the reviews alone are one of the best reads I've had in a very very long time! I've never been more proud of my fellow Americans. Fight the power. Continue to post your reviews daily if necessary until the election and let your voice be heard!!! For the record I wouldn't even wipe my ass with the pages of this book if it was the last paper left in an apocalypse.

1.0 out of 5 starsA Sales Pitch For Corruption
ByDevonon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I like spending money at Amazon and I think they provide a great service, but if Amazon decides to back one of the most corrupt politicians in the history of this great country, I will have no choice but to spend my money elsewhere. As for Hilary Clinton's book...I would rather chew on a ball of tin foil than read whatever lies she has chosen to foist upon us.

1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon Is Removing Negative Reviews
ByFleischen DePannon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Amazon is removing negative reviews of this book. Last week there were well over 1000 reviews and the book had an average 1 star rating. Amazon is censoring reviews and removing bad ones to make the average review look better. Shame on Amazon. Anyway, I read this book and it is as boring and vapid as she is, so no surprise there.

1.0 out of 5 starsStay far, far away!
ByAmir Fazadhon September 25, 2016

Downloaded a Kindle version on my PC, and now my computer has pneumonia. I may have to put it down...perhaps if I shipped it to Benghazi, they would do that little chore for me? How is her nose not 15 feet long by now, if Pinocchio's nose is any indicator? This is pure dreck, should be in the "Fiction" category, not autobiographies.

I gave it a one star rating, because Anazon doesn't allow fractionals...otherwise, I'd have rated it a .0000001 star. She's a liar, a thief, and a manipulator, much like her boss George Soros.

Bought this book a week ago because I have a strong interest in learning what it takes to buy the FBI. I also hoped this fine piece of literature contained instructions on how to purchase a U.S. presidency built on lies and corruption, or get away with murder, but I ended up having to reallllly read between the lines. Guess I'll stick to "At Night She Cries, While He Rides His Steed". Also, I like how Amazon is now suggesting I purchase a bulletproof vest.

I'm beginning to get the feeling of what it must be like to live in a country where freedom simply does not exist and where the rich and powerful control (or attempt to) the other 99%. Keep deleting negative reviews if it makes you feel better and suits your agenda.

Nothing Hillary says or writes resonates with 'the people'. It is very obvious and people all know that Hillary will say one thing and then the opposite the next hour just to ponder. Hillary has no principle or any position. The book reeks of hypocracy.

1.0 out of 5 starsWorse than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick

I really tried to read this, I really did, but I couldn't get past the cover picture of Shrill and her manboy Kaine. As I considered gouging my eyes out with a sharpened teaspoon, I pondered: "Will Jim Foster be voting for Hillary in November?"

My guess is yes, because he supports all of her platforms that she hasn't announced yet. Besides, he's only been dead for a couple decades so is probably still on the voter rolls in Illinois or one of those other ethical places.

Reading this book was like getting a root canal without Novocain. The truth is I couldn't read the entire thing. Afterwards when I was looking at the reviews for this book I read one saying Amazon has manipulated the number of reviews for this book to make it not look as bad as it is. The fact is, it is as bad as I and a majority of reviewers have said it is. Changing the numbers cannot change the facts. Please be honest with us your loyal customers.

I am a Democrat and I wish I really, really, wish I could be a Hillary supporter. However, this book would have been an excellent place for her to explain what happened at Benghazi when Ambassador Chris Stevens and three security contractors lost their lives.

Since she didn't address this act of war against an American ambassador and three of his associates and what she was doing at the time, I'm sorry, I just can't support her or endorse her book.

BZZZZT. One star.

1.0 out of 5 starsI was going to read this book
ByCyndi Hatleyon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
“I was going to read this book … I really was. But just as I got started, I found myself under sniper fire, passed out, and fell and hit my head. After that I got double vision and had to wear glasses that were so damn thick I couldn’t even see to read. As if that wasn’t enough, I then had an allergic reaction to something and started coughing so hard I spit out what looked like a couple of lizard’s eyeballs, my limbs locked up, and I passed out and fell down again, waking up only to find out I had been diagnosed with pneumonia 2 days earlier. Somehow I managed to power through it all, but it’s a good thing I was able to make a small fortune on this random small trade in the commodities market (cattle futures or some such thing) and then, miracle of all miracles, a few banks offered me a few million to just talk to their employees for a few minutes – and all that really helped out because I swear I was dead broke and couldn’t figure out how I was gonna come up with the 6 bucks to pay for this book, let alone pay the $1,500 for my health insurance this month. I still want to read it, but, honestly, what difference at this point does it make? I hear it sucks anyway.”

1.0 out of 5 starsTim Kaine's Marxist roots
ByJoseph Knechton September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Thinking Americans are aware how completely corrupt and incompetent Hillary Clinton is, but most don't know much about Tim Kaine, other than he has a reputation as a "conservative Democrat." The fact is Kaine's philosophy is more Marxist than Conservative.

On Sept. 4 the New York Times reported that during his year (he took a year off from college to work wth Jesuit missionaries) in Honduras, Kaine embraced the "liberation theology" of the Latin American radicals and revolutionaries of the 80s. The article adds this was a radical Marxist-based ideology at odds with the Church, the Pope and the United States, but supportive of the Soviet Union.

Academic and journalistic research has since shown that Liberation Theology was the product of a Soviet disinformation campaign in Catholic countries. Top-ranking Soviet bloc defector Gen. Ion Pacepa admitted to personal involvement in the operation.

Another reason to be wary of Kaine is that he has consistently supported Obama's failed foreign policy.

I have seldom read anything that panders to such a low mean intelligence. Clinton and Kaine must assume we don't live in the real world and can be manipulated as easily as young children (below the age of 10, let's say).

One thing the book did accomplish for me was to finalize my decision: I will never vote for Hillary and my previous ambivalence about Trump's personality attributes is mostly resolved.

I hope this is her "swan song" and her voice will no longer assault us in public spaces.

They should've titled this book "Stronger Without Her." She should've used this space to apologize to the families of the people who died on her watch. She could've offered some explanations for why she falls down all the time, or even more excuses for all of the damage she's done to countries around the world -- BUT NO! Instead, she fills the pages with lies and promises that she can never keep!

She hasn't fixed anything YET - and her book offers nothing more. Spend your money on something worth a few bucks. This was a waste of my time.

A thoroughly unenjoyable romp that, not surprisingly, avoids all of the subjects any reader would actually enjoy learning more about. For example:

1) Is Bill still "dickin bimbos" behind her back as alleged by Colin Powell?
2) What fake name did Obama use when emailing her on her unclassified server - and why did he lie about doing so?
3) What are the odds of her living 4 more years with all of her mysterious health issues?
4) What fell out of her pant leg when she passed out and had to be carried to her motorcade during 9/11 memorial?
5) Why does her foundation accept money from countries that oppress women, gays, and minorities?
6) Why do so many people involved in investigations of her suddenly die under bizarre circumstances?
7) Why would she pick a VP candidate she called a "terrible choice" in her own book about 2008 campaign?

I probably would not recommend this one, folks.

If I could give "0" stars I would. This trash masquerading as a book has to be the single biggest piece of propaganda ever written. I can imagine that whoever actually wrote this book is some bow-tied, bumkissing intern somewhere who wants to climb the progressive, ultra-left political ladder. They were told what to write from start to finish. This book is a hailmary attempt to "inspire" the not-very-bright among us to help resuscitate a failed campaign by the most corrupt presidential candidate in history. File under: fireplace kindling.

BySexyPantsuitLuvron September 24, 2016

I came here looking for a book about the United States European Command (EUCOM), and all I found was this hack of a rip-off book.

It seems the only thing HRC has done during her tenure as Secretary of State was to steal EUCOM's motto, "Stronger Together." No coincidence either that EUCOM's motto was coined about six months before, under the command of ADM Stavridis, just months before she committed gross negligence/manslaughter and sold out AMB Chris Stevens and our clandestine services operating in Libya, running weapons to daesh in Syria through the Muslim Brotherhood. If you're looking for a book about EUCOM in 2012, keep on looking, this is not the book for you.

I borrowed this book from a disgusted friend who had purchased it, and I agree with just about everyone else who has reviewed it. I strongly doubt Clinton and Kaine had the time to write this themselves in the middle of a campaign, unless HIllary did it during her sick down time. It has nothing of substance to offer...just platitudes and, of course, an appeal for votes. She's not getting mine.

1.0 out of 5 starsMore lies and garbage from the most evil people...
BySenor Nahualon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
A little over 8 years ago I contributed to her campaign against Obama. Looking back now I just shake my head at how ignorant and gullible I was. Both of these people turned out to be nothing short than monsters set on the destruction of our once great nation. Evil has many names and two of them are Obama and Clinton.Now, barely able to stand,constantly coughing,eyes going askew,seizure having, psychopath Clinton, along with her, ha ha, running mate Kaine come out with this piece of utter garbage. Kaine, a nobody until now, is a globalist like his masters. He and Clinton want to eliminate all borders, cultural identities and most of all FREEDOM and the Constitutional rights bestowed to us by people far far wiser than them. There is no way she 'wrote' this book. She is a 70 year old, old woman who can't stand by herself, who lies constantly and who reallly and truly despises us, the common people. She and her running mate who will take over when she dies from all her crippling and chronic conditions, are the servants of people like billionaire George Soros who is one of those responsible for bringing islam here to destroy us and all Western culture. Our country has not been ours for a long time, the young have been brainwashed by the elite owned media, desensitized to violence and immorality, and made into raging zombies by these people. What is so scary is that good smart people can be totally taken in by this evil. I was but no longer thanks to the real true alt media such as Drudgereport, Breitbart, etc. This book is more of their poison, terribly written. Wake up!
PS: noticed that if you try to read the reviews,amazon won't let you, just keeps showing the first 2 or 3 pages of reviews, even though there are hundreds of bad reviews for this really bad book by a really bad person.

1.0 out of 5 starsI love Amazon, and hope there is no political games ...
ByTroyon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
It was reported just days ago when the book was being savaged with negative reviews, with 81 percent one-star ratings and an average of only 1.7.
Clinton supporters lashed out at “trolls” they said were criticizing the book only because they oppose the Democrat’s presidential candidacy.
It was previously reported there were more than 1,200 reviews, and the number grew to than 2,000, but Thursday afternoon, there were only 255, with many of the most critical reviews removed. I love Amazon, and hope there is no political games occurring. I prefer honesty, even when it's painful. Really tied of the lies/scandals/cheating coming out of the Clinton camp and I hold everyone that lies/spins the truth for her, just as guilty.

1.0 out of 5 starsHillary's Fairytale
ByAlexon September 23, 2016
Format: Paperback
Stronger Together aka helping the one percent, wall street, greedy pharmaceutical companies, defense contractors, and the establishment. If you honestly believe Hillary and Tim will unite this country, you need to really wake up. Not only is Hillary mentally incompetent to run this country she is mentally unfit to write this book. As one who unfortunately read this book, a Hillary presidency will be exactly be like this book, one ran/written by someone else. Hillary barely wrote this book presumably because she was sick with some mysterious disease ( cough cough Parkinson's). It was mostly written by Tim Kaine who presumably would be leading this country if Hillary is elected because of her health. Hillary and Tim talk about how they will bring jobs back, bring savings to debt laden college students, and helping refugees and illegal immigrants all while not raising the 20 trillion national debt. I really find it interesting because its impossible to achieve any of those goals without raising more debt. I know Hillary was probably drugged when writing this but couldn't any of her 1,000 plus staff have reworded it to make it more realistic. Guess not, if she wants to become president. Anyways, save your hard earned and hard to come by money on something more pleasurable than this terrible book.

However, I soon developed pneumonia, Parkinson's, Turret's, selective memory loss, temper tantrums, abusive attacks on others, pathological liar's syndrome and was overcome by a wave of right wing conspiracy. I am still fighting these ailments and my medical costs have far outweighed the savings on this supposed bargain purchase. Avoid at all costs.

2.0 out of 5 starsThe Name of the book should be changed to: ...
ByBlack Bubbaon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
The Name of the book should be changed to: Seditious Together.

The constitution of the United States of America makes it extremely clear what the general duties are of those whom govern over us:

1) Establish Justice. Hillary Clinton is against justice. Instead her book proves that her motive is to: Establish Social Equality which is an establishment that undermines justice and a president that did this would be seditious to her duties should she swear an oath to the United States Constitution.

2) Ensure Domestic Tranquility: Hillary Clinton is against tranquility, and instead, her book is a testament to her desire to Cause Domestic Anxiety by pitting blacks against whites, Immigrant against citizen, women against men, the sick against the healthy, the old against the young. Her insistence that we must all sacrifice to her demands that others be equal demonstrates that should she be president would make demands that generate domestic anxiety and thus be seditious to her duty to ensure tranquility.

3) Promote the General Welfare. Hillary Clinton prescribes solutions that do not advance the general prosperity of the United States, but instead, expand the entitlement society and the Welfare State. Her book is a testament to her desire to compromise the General Welfare of America in order to advance the Welfare Dependency state based upon her desire to undermine those who have been successful, which would destroy the opportunity ladder of America. As a matter of fact her husband has explicitly stated that "Hillary Wants to bring the totem pole (ladder of opportunity in America) crashing down so we can all be equal and "Move Forward Together". Her book is a testament that should she be elected she will be seditious against her duty to Promote the General Welfare.

4) Provide for the COMMON DEFENSE. Hillary's Life story is a saga of a woman in high power that consistently perverts the duty to provide for the Common Defense by Providing for the Defense of her power and her foundation and her political party. She has demonstrated through personal decisions at critical moments that her interest is in Providing for the Defense of her power even when it compromises and undermines the defense of our people. She has been seditious for her entire life against the duty to "Provide for the Common Defense" and her book shows that she cares more about placating radical islamists, whom are not even permitted to preach openly in most Islamic countries, than she cares about the defense of her country. Should she be elected, she will continue to be seditious against this duty as well.

And finally, Hillary Clinton is forever seditious against her duty to: 5) Secure the Blessings of Liberty for ourselves and our posterity. Instead she is committed only to: "Securing the Power for herself and her Party". Hillary seeks to undermine God at every vestige point in American Society and seethes with contempt towards the concept that a Creator provides us with Liberty. She is incapable of distinguishing between Liberty and Tyranny and is interested in the power for herself and her party not the liberty of her country-men.

Hillary's book should be titled Seditious Together. American Presidents should inspire their citizens to: "Pursue Happiness" or to pursue their own prosperity. Instead Hillary inspires people to "Pursue Equality" which was the pursuit of Lucifur who was Envious that he did not receive the glory or the worship and did not have the same power as God. Hillary inspires people to "Pursue Equality" The pursuit of the Damned. Not the pursuit of an American.

Hillary is seditious against America and is an abomination to it's constitution.

Unfortunately, the lowest rating I could give was one star. It doesn't even deserve that. Starting with the title which makes absolutely no sense, the entire book is a series of talking points and lies by lawyers and con artists. It has no redeeming qualities other than to show America what a deceitful and useless mess the two of these "authors" have colluded on. I doubt if either of them actually worked on this "book". It is an artificial and superficial piece of ghost written blather with no soul, no point of view, no truth, no perspective and no point. I could not read a chapter without regretting the time I just wasted and I had to stop halfway through because I just could not read anymore of it. It was soooo bad.

I thought Clinton was better than this, but the tone of the book is really divisive. She seems to think that anyone that disagrees with her is not just wrong but stupid. It is apparent from her book that she thinks she is better than the "regular" people. Her ideas policies are clearly designed to benefit her banker friends and to ensure she continues to receive millions of dollars each year from the rich and politically connected.

The policies she lays out in tedious detail in the book are nothing more that her vision to make government bigger and more intrusive than ever. I hope she will have plenty of time to spend with her grand children after the election.

Her pay to play antics as the SOS, failure to help our ambassador and his cohort in Benghazi, the subsequent lies about the reason it happened as well continual lying about her e-mails are enough to have her up on charges; I feel quite sure that the FBI didn't press the issue as Director Comey didn't want to be the next Vince Foster or any of the others in a LOOONNG string of her acquaintances and business associates who have died under questionable circumstances.

I've actually read this book and while I respect Clinton for what she admits she wants to do with this country, (reform education, infrastructure, tax laws, gun laws, inner city,etc) its how she plans to do it that is most frightening. Like her predecessor, she will attempt to use Congress, but if they refuse to go along with her party's plan, it's straight to executive orders. She is the embodiment of the failings of our country's political process and her book (obviously written ghost-written and a compilation of policy papers) reflects that. It's obvious from her book that she has no trust or respect for the American people and puts the needs of her special interest constituents first.

BySteven Woodcockon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Pretty bad when you have SUCH terrible reviews for such a terrible book outlining a terrible future for America that you have to call your buddies at Amazon to "correct" them.

I generally found this book detestable (one might even say deplorable) and found I didn't recognize the America that was described and even less the one she and Kaine want to subject us to. There ARE (to be fair) a couple of funny passages and anecdote style stories, but generally the plan presented was so horrific that the good feelings didn't last long.

Terrible book. Save your money, and save your country too.

Maybe you'll feel the wrath the Dallas newspaper felt after its endorsement of Billary. But maybe my money as a customer is "deplorable."
After, half of Trump supporters are deplorable, according to your celebrated author. You might want to re-think this one, Bezos, before it's too late.

1.0 out of 5 starsOne Star
BySilverGhoston September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Wonder if she can screech in a book like she does in person? Also, I didn't know that Amazon goes in an manipulates the ratings of their merchandise! For future reference, I'll ignore Amazon reviews, and go elsewhere for opinions. Then I'll buy from Ebay since they are generally less expensive anyway. I'll keep Amazon Prime, as I listen to their music. I seldom use Amazon Prime Video, since they only have a fraction of the number of movies that Netflix does. I just had to add one more ONE STAR review on the book, since it'll probably get deleted anyway.

Why I even have it one star is a mystery. Hillary and Kaine are the two biggest buffoons in politics today. DO NOT BUY THIS TOILET PAPER IN A BINDER ! Absolutely horribly written and packed full of lies.

Format: Paperback
She asked for a stool to stand on so she wouldn't appear short while debating Donald Trump. She had her podium custom build to minimize their height difference. It won't help, she can't measure up, just like having hundreds of negative reviews deleted from this book won't help either.

Short morals, short ethics, short confidence, and self esteem.

1.0 out of 5 starsThese should be handed out for free and not purchased..It's just a pamphlet of rhetoric
ByThe Gitardon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I wish I had the time back in my life it took to read this book. I thought I was going to see some actual plans to rebuild the nation. Instead this book is a collection of cliches and the usually rhetoric. I would have thought that someone like Hillary Clinton, that has spent mostly her entire life in politics, would have more to offer. I was wrong. Don't waste your money on this propaganda pamphlet. It is an easy read though with larger than normal font and 5th grade reading level. By the way, Tim Kaine is making a Nazi salute on the cover, didn't the publisher check that?

An amazingly informative and entertaining read! No, not the book--the reviews. I read that Hil's backer Bezos has been a bad boy, bumping the back-to-back bad reviews with which the book has been besieged. This, her belles-lettres, only begin to befog, and befool the beggars. Beware the bombast lest you be banished to the "basket," there to bear the brazen backlash while your tax burden blooms. So, buy the book barbarians, be beguiled by the bull.

1.0 out of 5 starsBreaking news: Amazon reviews hosted on Hillary's email server
ByJoe Blounton September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
After extensive research I can confirm the cause of the mysterious deletions of this book's reviews.

Reviews for this book are hosted on Hillary's private server! Yes, I am aware this is not in accordance with Amazon policy, but that has never stopped Hillary before. Hillary hired an IT contractor to direct all her Amazon reviews to the private server running in her closet. She's reportedly using bleachbit to purge all the 1 start reviews.

But don't worry guys, after extensive review by her lawyer, she'll turn over all the reviews that she deems worthy of your reading.

2.0 out of 5 starsDidn't have the info I was hoping for
ByRickyDon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I was excited to see this book available at Amazon. I'm recently retired and was hoping it would lay out a blueprint on how to set up my own charity and earn millions. To my disbelief, not one word on the subject! My main income is derived from selling "Bernie for President" bumper stickers, so I was also in need of pointers on setting up my own server for my business in my bathroom. Once again, nothing! I was so disillusioned that Hills would withhold this important information that I was unable to eat or sleep for days. I weakened to the pointed that I got pneumonia, dehydrated, fell, hit my head. Surely this book would have pointers on how to recover from that, nope...just told me to wear "alien librarian" pantsuits and big, thick glasses. No one was fooled by these parlor tricks. Now I can't quit coughing, speak in my "outside" voice when I'm inside and my eyes seem to work independently of themselves. To sum up, don't read this book, it has ruined my life.

My review disappeared! I would not have paid one thin dime to read this nonsense. Who could believe a serial liar who wouldn't know the truth if it bit her on the nose? Kaine is no more qualified to be president than Hillary. The thought of either of them being the ruler of the free world is terrifying. I would like to continue living and have my children and grandchildren not pay the debts of the lazy and undocumented for the rest of their lives.

1.0 out of 5 starsWhat Difference Does it Make
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016

First off....reading these reviews gives me hope in the American people. Just this small sampling tells me if she is president, it won't be by the popular vote.
That being said, l reviewed the cover of the book; that photo op was sufficient enough for me to know the ladt thing l would ever want to do is read it.
Now...if Amazon removes this comment like they did with allegedly 2000 others, they need to revisit how much money l give them. I can easily shop at the many other online retailers.

1.0 out of 5 stars*STRONGER TOGETHER* BARF BAG COLLECTION! Free with each purchase!
Bymikeon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I was so pleased upon receipt of this book to note that an Official STRONGER TOGETHER BARF BAG COLLECTION was included. I was excited to see that they had included the Whole Collection: Hellary, Tim "Banker's Favourite" Kaine, Bill "Limp Dick" Clinton, Chelsea Hubbell Clinton, Debbie Washerwoman-Sheets, Donna "CleanUpGirl" Brazile, James "Careless" Comey, etc. etc. The hardest part was deciding WHICH bag to use first as I dove into this sick, sick volume.

Well, Hellary's bag filled quickly, just like her colostomy bag, and I was barely into the first chapter!! Needless to say, the hits (and the chunks of carrots from my gut) just kept on coming and in NO TIME I had filled the entire STRONGER TOGETHER BARF BAG COLLECTION! (There was a problem with Billy's bag: the bottom broke out and spilled carrot chunks all over Hellary's picture on the cover but....hehehehe!)

Perhaps the best part of this book is the weight. We had a nice cool breeze come up and I found that if I wedged this sucker under the front door it wouldn't blow closed.

NOW......the real test to you, Jeff Bezos, is how fast your little MediaMatters/Correct The Record Soros-paid single-digit IQ drone-trolls will once again sweep through the reviews and purge the comments that fail to Toe The Party Line.

With that it mind, and hoping to confuse the simple-minded "True Blue No Matter Who" human troll-drones, I will state: "I'M WITH HER!!!"

Listened to the audio version. I tried to keep an open mind but it was just drivel, a bunch of fluff with no substance. I couldn't make it past the second chapter.

1.0 out of 5 starsbut from what I read I can tell you that it was a waste of money
ByJohn Navarroon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
To be honest I was unable to finish the book, but from what I read I can tell you that it was a waste of money. Nothing, absolutely nothing in the book convinces me that she has a clue what is going in the country. She is an arrogant elitist surrounded by elitist sycophants who live life in a filtered and out of touch reality. Has visited a border town? NO. Has she visited a small town over run with refugees and illegal immigrants? NO. Has she visited a town in rural America where you can longer find work if you don't speak Spanish? NO. She is about globalism, America last. The book is a con about accepting everyone but Americans in efforts to build up / stack the Democratic base PURE and SIMPLE. We are supposed to feel sorry for an illegal that does not belong in our country, who kids have over filled our schools, over worked teachers due to ESL issues, hospitals are over run (don't get me started on affordable - LOL - care act). She is absolutely clueless, she is in it for the power, to enrich WallStreet and to continue a third Obama term. She is willing to sacrifice our nations sovereignty, national security, the welfare, well being and safety of EVERY real American citizen at the expense of not hurting the feeling of illegals, islamic terrorists and atheist. The book is a joke, buy the book "Clinton Cash" in cartoon form. Not only is that book more factual, but it is entertaining as well. God help us if she wins, that is one thing the book convinced me of.

1.0 out of 5 starsDeplorable!!!
ByCal-Jon September 25, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Deplorable. The ideas from this side of the ticket do nothing to advance the American people as a whole. This election revolves around a few simple questions:

1. Are you better of financially than you were 8 years ago? The stats from the Census bureau itself give us the emphatic answer of: NO.

2. Is the homeland safer? Do you feel safer voting in more of the same with the delusional idea that we are not at war with radical Islam? If you can't name your enemy how can you draft a plant to defeat them.

3. Do you want to see the ideals of this country continue to be forcibly changed via the nomination of Supreme Court justices from this side of the ticket?

4. Do you want to elect a pathological liar? Her crimes against this country are unacceptable and it's time to clean out Washington. Had any one of us "regular" citizens committed even .05% of the crimes she has committed we would have been in the slammer rotting away for the rest of our lives.

This deplorable is ready for real hope and change. Enough is enough.

1.0 out of 5 starsNice. Then
ByJayeon September 15, 2016
Format: Paperback
I was going to buy this inspirational book because Hillary said she's 'always worked for women and children, all her life.' And, she said that victims of sexual assault 'have a right to be believed.' But then I remembered Juanita Broadrick, Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and all the other women used and abused by Slick Willy and threatened and destroyed by Hillary's operatives who employed their 'nuts and sluts' narrative to ruin these women's lives and cover up the vicious, money-grubbing, self-serving juggernaut that is the Clinton Crime Machine. One line that particularly stuck with me was this 'inspiring' narrative allegedly attributed to James Carville--that Paula Jones was what you get when you drag a $20 bill through a trailer park. Nice.

Then, thinking I may be too hard on the Clintons, I decided to rethink everything. But then I remembered the TWELVE year old rape victim and Hillary defending the rapist, claiming the TWELVE year old had 'fantasies about older men' and lured the rapist. I remembered that Hillary won that case, the rapist served less than a year and Hillary cackled and laughed about it, saying it was 'so easy' to tear that little girl to shreds.

1.0 out of 5 starsTop of the NY Times Fiction Best Selers list
ByP. Delaneyon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I was going to write a good review, but then everyone would think I was one of the people getting paid to say how great this book of fiction is. Then I was not going to write a review because I didn't want to end up on Hillary's enemies list and get killed like so many others. But them I figured out that with her double vision, poor health, and her inability to understand modern technology like a fax machine or the letter "C" marking classified information, let alone how to erase your old cell phone without resorting to a hammer, she probably wouldn't be able to navigate the Amazon website and read this review in order to track me down and kill me. At least she will have a customized podium for her debate with Trump so she doesn't look so small. Now, if only she would give back all of the donations from the countries in the middle east that hate and kill gays, Christians, Jews, and treat women like a sub-species. After all, she has done so much for women's rights, the LGBT community, as well as promoting religious tolerance (islamac radicalism).

Deplorable. This book is 250 pages of lies. It brainwashes the sheep into believing that they are free while it talks about how Hillary's big government engineers society to keep the people in poverty while voting for her so she can use the government for her own financial gain. it's sick.

1.0 out of 5 starsI thought I would replace one of the bad reviews of this book that Amazon has deleted
ByShootron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I thought I would replace one of the bad reviews of this book that Amazon has deleted. With actions like that they are about to delete me as a customer while they're at it. Jeff Bezos is so in the tank for Hillary he had his Washington Post hire an army of Trump bashing journalists. Just consider this turnabout being fair play. He's not the only one who can stack the deck. I'm a Prime customer but I'm having second thoughts about where my money is going. He has a right to his views but to cheat the results of the reviews of this book is beyond the pale.

1.0 out of 5 starsFrom the Ministry of Propaganda!
ByKenneth J. Fieldson September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Nothing new here. Just an outline of the peaches and cream plan to subjugate and control the global population. How this woman can be considered a serious option for president sadly reveals the extent that the citizenry of the USA have fallen. Maybe what the actual readers of this collection of fairy tales should be reading, and which could be beneficial to them, are books on such subjects as: Cognitive Dissonance, Suspension of Reality, The Hegelian Dialectic, and other such subjects. Or maybe, since ignorance is bliss, they choose to remain blissfully ignorant and STILL vote for Clinton just because she has a vagina. It would serve America better if she had a brain instead, at least a working one!

The entire drap content of this book sent me into coughing fits that i could not control, so i figured the book to be some kind of voodoo trickery. I then proceeded to make a fantastic pant-suit out of all the pages, the only way to destroy the spell.
But seriously, this book really is democratic, sociopathic propaganda that even if Morgan Freeman read the Audible version would still make you "commit suicide."

Once again, we see the absolute, blatant, CRIMINALITY of the Clinton crime cabal-supporters in the press, doing all they can to salvage this horrid book, chief among them the CEO of this site, yes, Amazon's very own Jeffy Bezos, who, btw, also owns the Washington Post, who hired a special "hit team" of 20 pimple faced chicken chokers to attempt to dig up dirt of Donald Trump. The negative reviews amounted to over 2000 just a day or so ago, then magically, dropped to 200 or so. Kinda like the cattle futures, right, Hillary? Just mysterious numbers appearing. This book is garbage, written by a filthy garbage collector named sHillary Rotten Klinton. The book, like her, blows big time. Throw it out, along with hillary's filthy soiled diapers.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe reviews were merciless and many quite funny (though mostly accurate)
ByJimicau'q Austinon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Four days ago (the morning of Sept 19) there were 898 reviews of this book. By evening there were 983 reviews. The reviews were merciless and many quite funny (though mostly accurate). This morning I look and there's 209 reviews. Hmmmmm, what happened to all those other reviews? Apparently Clinton has friends at Amazon.

Edited to add: In the WND article there was a comment " This may be the first book to receive more reviews than sales" and I think that's possible. Meanwhile Hillary is laughing all the way to the bank. First she gets an $8 million dollar advance from Simon and Schuster for her last abysmal failure and now she's getting somewhere around $14 million for this book. The woman could hustle Bernie Madoff.

It's a lesson in becoming a professional liar.

She's orchestrated a political house of cards built on her version of the truth, as an American, I am offended that she would think I'm stupid enough to buy all of her....as a southerner (and Arkansan) basic etiquette dictates that the word I want to use would reflect poorly on my upbringing; let's just say horses and cows make plenty of it!!

1.0 out of 5 starsThird World, Together
ByEduardo Veigaon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
The book is a blue print to turning the United States of America into a Third World republic, under the assumption, of course, that the republic stays together, which may be unrealistic given the authors propensity to balkanize the American public in almost every policy proposal. So the proposals go from making college education "tuition free" (i.e., paid via taxes) to "free" health care (i.e., paid via taxes). There are two key features in all of their economic proposals. Firstly, to break the link between those who benefit from a proposal and who pays for it, which obviously creates a rational incentive to over-consumption and waste (like when a large dinner table evenly divides the bill, thus creating the incentive to order expensive menu items in order not to be on the losing end of the night). Secondly, to assume that the U.S. Treasury is a bottomless resource, even though the federal debt is already 100% of GDP as of today, if you ignore the federal IOUs in the Social Security and Medicare "trust funds". Besides the economic proposals, there are proposals to favor this or that race in detriment of the other races (i.e., government-sponsored discrimination) and proposals to outlaw hugely popular classes of firearms, as if the 2nd Amendment was an afterthought. The book makes for a nauseating read unless you believe that the United States will remain wealthy and free no matter what its leaders throw at it, as if that status was a law of nature.

She apologized for absolutely nothing in this book. She has done absolutely nothing in this book to improve perception of her disastrous record.

P.S. She even described Tim Kaine as a third-rate VP choice in the book. Did anyone even bother proofreading?

By stronger together, she meant the corrupted collusion she has formed with the President, FBI during the time she served as the Secretary of State. I don't care about politics but this woman is easily the most corrupt politician I have seen ever since I was born. She made all the corrupt politicians in China and the Philippines look like her pupils. Lying, cheating, stealing, deceits, power-hungry, etc ... She has all and that just scared me. Anybody still endorsing after what she did to Bernie was simply beyond clueless at this point and probably treads into the dumb and retards category.

Although I was initially turned away from reading this book due to Tim Kaine's Nazi-like salute on the front cover, I decided to give it a try. I didn't get far. Without any original content, the book becomes a desperate plea for votes and a 288 page political advertisement. After supporting Bernie Sanders, I was trying to find something I liked about the Clinton-Kaine team... but I found absolutely nothing. In fact, I ended up despising them after reading this book.

Gee, Amazon, gonna delete this one, too? My comment was factual. There's all kinds of comments here. Let's try again, shall we?

What a lame attempt at deceiving the American people yet again. What IS hilarious is that this book sold ONLY 2,912 copies the first week it was released. You can look it up. From the lies on Benghazi, a cover-up to steal the 2012 election regarding same, to The Clinton Foundation, to her VERY serious health issues (she needs to be under a doctor's care 24/7). Tim Kaine is another useful tool for Obama when this disaster started 7.5 years ago. Notice her shrinking crowds; shrinking very quickly. The American people are catching on.

I purchased this book, because I am female and she's female, too. I was very confused, though, because the Table of Contents listed chapter titles that were the exact opposite of the chapter titles within. How could this happen? Also, I think the overall content was a little flimsy; each chapter just contained some campaign slogans, ads for the military contractors, Wall Street investment brokers, massage parlors and adult diapers! WTH? Why would I pay good money for that? One Star. Boo. Oh, wait. It was nice that there was a postage paid envelope included in the back for donations.

1.0 out of 5 starsHire Better Ghost Writers - - - Terribly Boring
Byjerryon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Kind of a waste and appears to be written on a fifth grade level (maybe sixth or seventh - depending where you're from)- - - hard to explain, it's almost like writing a circus story where you could read a page, then randomly skip to another page, and end up with the same degree of organization as if you had read the book straight through - - - perhaps intentional. Just a huge lack of organization and idea flow with very few transitions - - - it would be nice if they had hired better writers who might understand what a topic sentence is or the function of a paragraph. I understand that political campaign books are hardly ever written by those running for office; however, it is important that quality writers are involved to do it right, not put out garbage like this - - - and so boring - - - does not help the campaign. Even the image on the front of the book makes her look like she is the candidate for VP and not President - - - where were the image people. If she were to drop out, and Mr. Kaine turned out to be the candidate, the book might be a tad more appropriate.

1.0 out of 5 starsShe should have called this book, "If I were a Criminal, I'd be a Genius"
ByAlex Moroseon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
You know, HRC always struck me as such an odd choice for a presidential candidate just because of the way she handled the whole thing from the beginning. We all know her history. Even our PARENTS know her history. For her to run on the basis she is the straightforward hardworking candidate is like putting makeup on a shovel and telling everyone you have a new girlfriend at home.

The funny thing is, and I really hope she reads some of these reviews, is that if she ran as a CRIMINAL, she would have won. Her list of achievements as a politician is deplorable. Guess where I got that word from? But if she ran, telling everyone the truth about how deep she managed to corrupt the entire American political system for years, I might have actually thought that she earned a little bit of recognition. The fact that she is allowed to run is such a farce, and every time I see her on TV I imagine how deep her pockets and connections have to be reach the level of protection from the law that she has. If she came clean on EVERYTHING, and I mean everything, her list of corruption becomes a list of achievements. If she wrote a book only focused on that subject alone, it would probably be a bestseller. Some food for thought.

Oh, and this is just obvious. If you want a book to sell, your audience matters way more than your book does. If you're a politician who writes a book after a huge public scandal, people will buy the book hoping for more information on the scandal than the author. No one wants to read a policy book by Hillary Clinton. A complete book written by her about her vast number of legal troubles and escapes would captivate audiences everywhere.

I really hope she doesn't win the 2016 election, are we are all in for a bumpier ride that we already are...

1.0 out of 5 starsI had great hopes for this book and for Hillary Clinton's candidacy
Bybilly30on September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
As a life-long democrat, I had great hopes for this book and for Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Sadly, I find that the positions and policies put forth in this book are surprisingly skim on detail and set forth in a way that makes the reader want to nod off out of boredom. I question the sincerity of a candidate who has reaped enormous wealth during her tenure as Sec of State following upon her nearly total ineffectiveness as senator of my home state of NY. She promised upstate NY jobs and failed to deliver. Further, as a health care professional, I am also deeply concerned that she may be unfit to serve based upon her long-time, disturbing record of collapsing, stumbling and having extended coughing fits during public appearances. If she is as ill as she appears to be then I'm deeply offended by her placing her own ambitions before her country, and so very disappointed that her family has not persuaded her to step aside for her own well-being. None of these concerns are effectively disarmed by this book.

1.0 out of 5 starsNo stars, but they forced me
Byremnant 0888on September 25, 2016

Didn't read it. And it belongs in fiction. Even if she gave the money to charity, or if They [Amazon] puts it on Kindle for free, as a bonus to Amazon customers, I'd rather watch cartoons with my 2 year old granddaughters ..and see all the Dora cartoons ever made ...then read this fairy tale.
Hey Amazon, maybe you could put it on audio book and let her mind numbed robots listen while they receive their Checks in the mail.

Shallow. I was hoping for a book that was thoughtful and enlightening. I was hoping to learn something new - a new perspective on America and politics. But no. This book is full of cliche's and bromides that are superficial and pointless. It is also very redundant.

1.0 out of 5 starsDisappointed its not a how to do it book
ByAmazon Customeron September 18, 2016
Format: Paperback
I had hoped that this was a how to do it book on how to get rich beyond my wildest dreams while bilking donors out of millions of dollars while avoiding paying taxes and using my office as Sec. of State in a pay to play scheme while giving special favors to donors who donate to my fake charity and how to avoid being prosecuted for money laundering and racketeering in what has to be the biggest Ponzi scam ever? What a let down because we deplorable Americans want to know her secret, its not everyone who could get away with this kind of charity fraud while using their position as a pay to play and call it good government. I was also hoping she would have let us all in on that famous meeting between Lynch and Bill just days before Lynch was to announce if she was going to prosecute Hillary but as it turns out Lynch decided not to and said that the so called meeting was by chance and that her and Bill just talked about golf and grandchildren while Lynch's fellow travelers stood out on a tarmac in 100 degree heat so her and Bill could discuss grandchildren, I guess Bill must have given Lynch the good news that she would remain in her position if Hillary is elected for doing such an upstanding job at not prosecuting Hillary. Really Hillary this book would have been a sell out if it had been a how to get away with it all and get rich doing it book than some dull rant while calling hard working Americans deplorable.

1.0 out of 5 starsWhile I really TRIED to like this book
ByJim Don September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
While I really TRIED to like this book, I was incapable of doing so. Hillary did her usual dissembling regarding her illegal non-classified server at Department of State used to evade FOIA requests, the highly corrupt Clinton Foundation, "Pay-To- Play" at the Department of State, her disaster at Benghazi and her many serious health issues. She also failed to mention Bill's many sexual escapades...including the alleged rape of Juanita Broadrrick in 1978 and the $850,000.00 sexual harassment payment to Paula Jones, all part of the Clinton Legacy. And Tim Kaine questions NOTHING regarding her highly questionable ethics. How sad. This could've been such an interesting "Tell All" book. And thus my 1-star rating.

2.0 out of 5 starsMay cause fascism, dizziness, and pneumonia
Bymagon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
When I received the shipment from Amazon, I immediately tore open the packaging, as I was exited to read up on how to destroy America and wipe my backside with the constitution. I couldn't wait and started in before I had a chance to sit down. About 2 sentences into the first chapter, my body kind of froze. I felt weak and started to collapse. Fortunately my family members were nearby to catch me and drag me over to my reading chair. After having been administered a really swell drug cocktail, I came to, and realized they had to drag me so fast, that my shoe came off and was left laying near the front door!

I'm pretty sure this book gave me a wicked case of walking pneumonia

1.0 out of 5 starsHillary's Mein Kampf
ByTravis Bickleon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Mein Kampf clearly explained der Fürher's plans for the conquest of Eastern Europe and the enslavement of the "inferior races," yet no one listened. Now Hillary lays out her plans for the destruction of America and the abolishing of our Constitutional rights and the Elites clamor for her to be elected. She has warned us what she will do. If America elects her, we are doomed as a free nation. It is interesting that the title of this book is "Stronger Together," as that is the basis of the word Fascism which derives from the Roman sorry off the father who showed his son that while a stick could be broken easily, a bundle of sticks could not; they were "stronger together."

1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon is Deleting our Reviews
ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Amazon is Deleting negative Reviews. It's STILL rated horribly. Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon, is a major Clinton donor and owns the politically-aligned Washington Post.

Never did I think Amazon would start gaming the system for reviews on their main site. We all know they do it with owned IMDB.com, but this is tantamount to false advertising.

I hated the book, anyway. Hilldawg is a mess mentally, and it shows in this book, which lacks a coherent statement. It just seems like various marketing buzzwords and campaigns all jumbled together in a lumpy mess to make Hillary Clinton seem more intellectual right before the election.

Avoid like the plague.

1.0 out of 5 starsThey said it was horrible so I had to see for myself
ByMISSrepresentationon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I borrowed this from a friend. They said it was horrible so I had to see for myself. If it were my book, I would be using it as TP by now.

This is nothing more than her website regurgitated (which was my physical reaction 10 pages into it) and campaign cut and paste talking points. There is nothing new here that you are not bombarded with everyday in CNN. There are no policy details about how they will produce or balance a budget, address rising of of living, create jobs or fix the mess she created in the ME. Just plenty of pandering to minority groups in attempt to hobble together their victims to vote for them again in the most extreme case of stockholm syndrome in history.

I could not finish the book. After reading half of it I already knew the rest of it as it is repetitive with no vision, just rehashed failed policies of socialist days gone by. There is no revelation of how she will do anything different than Obama to address the economic failures that have resulted in the lowest labor participation rate in 40 years, double the number of people on food stamps since 2008, average household income 1k lower than 2008 and home ownership 4% lower than 2008.

I guess in Hillary's America, we are stronger going down the tubes together since 2008.

1.0 out of 5 starsWas not worth my time or money...
ByMary Joneson September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I did buy and read this book in it's entirety. The book is boring, and self-aggrandizing. I am an avid reader, and it was hard to get thru this book. I read books of all political persuasions. I did see that Amazon removed negative comments, I have been a long time Amazon shopper, it's always my first place to go to look to buy anything I want. But I have trouble when companies put politics into their business. I am here to purchase things I need, if I wanted Amazon's push to the Democrat side, I only need to go watch MSNBC or CNN. I don't need it here where I shop.

I would hope that Amazon would stop this trickery of the legitimate posts. The book itself appears to me to just have been thrown together, with just a few ideas here and there, and expanding on them. Some of the content was just eye rolling bad. I won't say what, don't want to ruin it for anyone else. If you really want to make a legitimate comment good, bad or indifferent, you do need to get the book and read it all.

I did read the book, but borrowed it from a friend, who is a Clinton supporter and is trying to convince me to change my vote. For me there is nothing exceptional about the book, and based on my knowledge learned from my past occupation, most books, especially with a celebrity on the front, are written by some poor, anonymous writer who will do anything to get his words published, even if they are under someone else's name. I decided to write this review after hearing about the deletion of poor reviews. How many books were actually purchased. And also based on my past experience, how many people know of the scam of politicians by both parties to "sell" books to their supporters by the case. And if you happen to ask for one, you might be given a case or two.-

Other than the fact that there are no concrete or reasonable solutions presented therein, but only platitudes to the gimmees and the leftists who are desperate to maintain control of the masses, I couldn't read the words written for clintoon by some speech writer because every sentence echoed in my head with the nasty entitled tone the old hag adopts whenever subjecting us to one more of her diatribes.
Don't spend your money on this useless campaign tool. The only thing she wants to make 'stronger together' is the federal government, and for this, we need to be afraid. Very afraid.

1.0 out of 5 stars13% five stars and 83% one star (and you can't give it no stars)!
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
This is awesome. 13% five stars and 83% one star (and you can't give it no stars)! And this is AFTER Amazon allegedly rigged or deleted reviews (in the finest Democrat style)!

Apparently actual Hillary fans (how many of those are there, really?) don't like to read much about her. They must be enthralled with the possibility of the first woman president, rather than her actual rap sheet, I mean, record. ("Isn't it obvious?") No sexism there, for sure!

If this Amazon rating is a reflective sample poll of the national electorate, Trump should have clinched it by early afternoon on November 8th!

Now what I don't understand is why liberals think that lying about things (like changing reviews) will help anything-- I'm not even talking about Hillary herself, I'm talking about the actual people supporting Hillary.

So Amazon, here's the deal: Because I trust my Tea Party more than I trust a liberal with a stack of cash, here's what's going to happen.

I won't buy anything else from Amazon until President Trump is inaugurated (and as you can tell from my order history, I buy a lot).

Share that profit, you Commies.

Aren't we in enough trouble from 8 years of Obummer? Do NOT waste your $$$ folks, go out and buy some cigarettes instead. They would be much better for you than this book.

She also lies to us constantly, puts herself above rules she mandates for us, and she despises the police force and milatary which secures all Americans. And who the hell knows what is really going on with her health after that seizure she had on 9/11... and she cannot go two days on the campaign trail without needing "rest"... Enough of her.

Or spend it on guns.....before this psychotic bitch steals the election and tries to outlaw them. Or spend it on Trump yard signs just to piss her off - and to watch her eyes do that weird split thing they have been doing lately. That alone is worth more than the price of this ridiculous piece of fiction.

I had acquired this book for a camping trip I and my family were planning. On the plus side it is a good sized book with over 200 pages, so the entire family was able to benefit from it. Now to the negative. The type of paper used in the printing of this book is so coarse that after a few wipes you are already looking for an alternative, (in drier climates where there is a scarcity of large leaves using this book will get old really fast).. In an emergency this book, backed up with some aloe, would probably suffice. I would still recommend bringing an ample supply of your favorite TT, Wet Wipes or even a bundle of old cut up T shirts.

ByMark Gehrkeon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
While reading it my mind "short circuited." She doesn't address the many extra-marital affairs of her husband. Which in my opinion is contary to being for woman's rights...she ignored the hurt and pain they went through. In fact, she added to by her denials. IF one is stronger together then why aren't they together?

ByJustin Gomezon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Picked this book up off the ground yesterday, some bum tossed it in my lawn while mumbling something about 50 points ahead...saw who was on the cover and immediately tried to burn the blasted thing. Oddly enough it was untouched by the flames!? Next I tried to rip out the pages but for ever 1 I ripped out 2 popped up in its place. The weirdest thing is all the pages are blank and if you write on them it just dissapears, like it's been deleted or wiped clean....I'm afraid of this book and it's evil. If anyone has any suggestions on how to kill please let me know.

1.0 out of 5 starsA waste of time and energy. Visit web site instead.
ByMarian B. Rodgerson September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
When I first looked over buying this book a couple of weeks ago it had over a thousand reviews. 80% of them were pretty brutal. I decided not to buy it but borrowed a friends because I didn't want to waste the money.
This is a boring, ill written book that will put you to sleep. It's a monotonous read. I would think with all the people Hillary has employed, she would get several people to proof read it and give feedback. Is everyone afraid of her? Why didn't they tell her she needed to spice it up?
I was hoping to learn a bit more than she reveals at her short rallies. She had made so few appearances I was losing interest. I have to admit I didn't finish it. I just couldn't.
Go to her web site. The book is a waste of cash.

1.0 out of 5 starsIt meets my expectations
ByHappy Amazon customeron September 22, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
My son gave me this book as a gift, which is why I didn't purchase it here, but I would have purchased it here but he beat me to it. So please, Hillary, take me off your Vince Foster "to do list." I would send you an e-mail but I am afraid it would end up in a bathroom e-mail server and get deleted.

Anyway, considering Vince Foster, Robert Bates, Ron Brown, and others, I don't want to whitewater, I mean, white wash my review. So Hillary, your ghost writer did a bang-up (no pun intended) job and someone no doubt will be given a Pulitzer, because that other guy already got the Nobel, so you missed out on that. Wait, maybe you could demand a Nobel for literature. Yea, you no doubt deserve it, because, after all, it's your turn. #HillaryForPrison

1.0 out of 5 starsShould be called "Richer Together" as Clinton plots to cash in on selling access to Presidential power to the highest bidder.
ByOldradiostuffon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
After reading this, I felt like I needed to put ice on my brain. It was swollen and bruised from the abuse. Clinton presents herself as the authoritarian's authoritarian. He solution to every problem is more government. Crime a problem? You need more government in the form of more gun control laws (I guess the 20,000 gun control laws already on the books nationwide were just practice for the real solutions). Education not cutting the mustard? You need more government. Jobs all gone? You need more government.

She really should have titled the book, "Richer Together" as that's her big aim in seeking the presidency - maximizing her cash flow by selling the ultimate access, to the President of the United States.

1.0 out of 5 stars- I found myself disappointed after reading this book
ByCommissioner Gordonon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Even though "Bedpan" Hillary excels at everything she has ever done in life - god damn, what a remarkable woman she is!- I found myself disappointed after reading this book. There is nothing of substance in it, much like the imaginary speeches that Goldman Sachs paid her $500,000 to make. One is left with the impression that there is something inherently dishonest about Hillary. Maybe a 35 year sentence in a Federal penitentiary would make her a better writer?

A BORING book filled with inane platitudes and sloganeering. The book could and should have been about 4 paragraphs long. Save your money and more importantly save your time. I offered it to some friends but no one wanted to read it. Ended up in the garbage. They were smarter than I was...

I really wasn't sure who to vote for this election cycle since I like neither Hillary or Donald. I did my best to research each candidate myself. Totally independently. After months of searching for answers, I now know a few things are certain..

#1 This book is absolutely terrible.
#2 If the book were actually about Hillary's personal views, She might have had a chance.
#3 The evidence I found of Hillary Clinton speaking at various events and conducting interviews contradicts almost everything in this book.
#4 I'm very pleased to say that I borrowed this book from a neighbor who coincidentally does not want it back.

I had to return this book because it obviously wasn't written by Hillary. I wished they had the courage to put the ghost writers name on the cover instead to be more transparent but I guess that is just a campaign slogan. The ideas presented in the book are woefully misguided as they have been tried by many socialist societies in the past and clearly do not work. Maybe after her defeat in November she will have time to edit this and produce another edition that explains why she took this project in the middle of a campaign instead of daily campaigning to push these outdated ideas.

Where to start? The book is full of hyperbole and nonsensical views.Hillary Clinton rolls out tired old taking points in her lawyerly way that make no sense to the working class person. If it can't any worse the book is filled of constant lies. If this book was actually fact checked by actual journalists (Not Crooked Washington Post or NY Times) it would keep them busy for months on end. Just read the intro and you'll be fast asleep without the need to medicate yourself. The earns 1 star because it does help reduce prescription drug costs by eliminating the need to purchase sedatives to help you sleep.

1.0 out of 5 starsReading actual blueprints would be infinitely more exciting.
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
If you find Hiilary's speeches as the most exciting thing in your life, you'll find the book an OK read. If you're looking for a thought provoking, informative blueprint into America's future, this isn't it. Regurgitated policies that have proven to fail without citing any actual research to bolster any assertions makes it a tough read.

Are you kidding me? This book is nothing but drivel. I think my dog may have been able to put this together in a few days. Anything in this book can be had just by listening to a few of their speeches and newspaper articles. Obviously, this is just a book put together to make some money.

1.0 out of 5 stars... prowl to destroy what is left of this once great America. Only this isn't a fictional novel
ByBerlantiBon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
A psychopathic murderer of Nations is on the prowl to destroy what is left of this once great America. Only this isn't a fictional novel, it is a blueprint of Hillary's plan to decimate America for her own personal financial gain, greed and mad desire for power. Maybe it would be a good mini-series or remake of Rosemary's Baby.

5.0 out of 5 starsBest damn purchase I every made!
ByZ as in Jerseyon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This might just be the best item I have ever purchased. It cures insomnia. It makes a terrific doorstop. I plan to nail it onto my front door on October 30 to keep my house from being egged by Millennials. It's pages make great bookmarks for other books that I actually intend to read. It reminds me why it is dangerous to put too much power into the hands of a few people, Jeff Bezos. The front cover picture of Tim Kaine giving the Nazi salute makes me wonder what the hell the publisher was thinking. It's title makes me wonder what, exactly, the message of the Clinton campaign is, and who it is aimed at. I enjoy the subtitle, "A Blueprint for America's Future," because the one thing I want more than anything is for the Democratic Party and its disturbed, sickly, weasily, corrupt, pathological scrunt of a standard bearer to create a blueprint for the future of a free people who used to be smart enough to laugh at the "Five Year Plans" adopted in totalitarian regimes.

Whew, I'm tired (unlike Hillary!, who is "no wise tarred"). I better go back upstairs under the watchful eye and with the assistance of my loyal handlers and lay down for a rest, followed by a Michael Jackson / Prince - style cocktail of drugs prepared by my full-time personal physician.

5.0 out of 5 starsThe Royal Scam, Denial, deceit and utter delusion. The Clinton's Orgy of Corruption....
ByC.D. of Austin TeXason September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
5 Big Stars of total Bull S***. Denial , deceit , delusion it can hardly be any worse. Neo-racist Hillary Clinton and her gang of goofy government gone wild hipsters juggle a nonstop orgy of criminal behavior while simultaneously attempting to navigate the river of dirty money cascading through the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And along the way have somehow managed to top it all off by manipulating the ineptitude of the DOJ & FBI and it director Jame Comey into the royal scam. An amazing maze of complete corruption at the highest levels of the US Government, and it is business as usual for the Clinton's and their supporters.

5.0 out of 5 starsWhen you wish upon 5 stars...
BySteve OhNo!on September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Yup, I give this a five star review! Amazon didn't like my one star one so I know when it's time to buckle under and conform. Of course this has only proved the Bezo's bias as the program is set to automatically post a 5 star one. Didn't believe it til I tried. Went up in a couple minutes, obviously not read! Thankyou for proving all us deplorable conspiracy theorists right! Now can I have 4 of my stars back. I need them for my soup. Otherwise it's just chicken. Better than eating crow I guess.

The globalist oligarchs have been stunned an stymied with the mass awakening of their serfs all across the globe. People are tired of being used and deceived and the more the elite strive to put the genie back in the bottle the more genies appear out of thin air! Populism=Humanism and is spreading like wildfire across the maps of empire! Interesting times indeed!

1.0 out of 5 starsNo Surprises
ByBryanon September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
An entertaining read .. if you care for the typical political drivel that comes from (any) political candidate for any office in the United States of America.

Much of the book outlines plans for expansion and addition of federal social programs with the predictable mantra that we can pay for these benefits by asking 'the wealthy to pay their fair share.' As an accountant, I have some insight into what that means. Our good friends at the IRS (What? They are not your friends?) publish quality statistics every year regarding how much total income there is available to tax in this fine country. When your favorite presidential candidate tells you they can finance a new social program and pay for it using only tax increases on 'the wealthy,' know that it can not be done by any rational definition of 'wealthy'. Do not take my word for it, take a look for yourself: [...] . Another reviewer described this book as a "Blueprint for Nationalizing America's Future," and that assertion is correct. The expansion of social programs called for in this book will likely require that 100% of all income in the country to be sent to Washington as income tax; as in all income from everyone is 100% taxed. Delightful!

My basic problem is that when I see a book like this advance the concept that 'the wealthy' can fund expansion of social programs and I know the author to be intelligent (even if you do not like Hillary Clinton, I hope you will allow she is not stupid), well informed, and experienced in U.S. politics and budgetary matters, I must conclude that the honorable Hillary Clinton is well aware of the fallacy presented in the book and chooses deception to convince the people to cast their vote her way. (Right, I just used waayy too many words to call Clinton a liar. But you knew that already.)

I do not care to be lied to. So, I did not care for the read.

I think my favorite quote, in light of recent behavior by Amazon, is from the introduction; “… we should be protecting people’s right to vote, not corporations’ right to buy elections.” From a certain point of view, Amazon's choice to delete unfavorable reviews is just a means to take their vast resources and highly visible role in American commerce to inappropriately influence the election. I have to wonder if Mr. Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post has influenced that publications egregiously biased coverage of this presidential election?

No need to waste your time on this book.

1.0 out of 5 starsA fairytale based on evil
ByBiker Arton September 20, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
This is about the Hildabeast and how she attacked the Bernie people by swooping in on her broom and buying off the delegates by offering 'power' if she gets elected, well, guess what, she is going to be in for a big surprise. How do I know, it because the book is a fairytale based on the Grimm brothers. She's never worked together with anyone to further her evil ambitions. Originally this was one of the reviews the HRC's friend, Jeff Bezo's had deleted - now tell me something, does this smell like something just might be rotten in DC or was he promised something in her dictatorship, such as a big political appointment. This whole thing about working together is just another BS line from HRC, and should she get in, have the GAO count the silverware at the WH. The Clinton's are just pure evil.

1.0 out of 5 starsI'm not buying this book
ByIndiana Revieweron September 18, 2016

Reason? It's not being provided as campaign material at no charge. Back in 2008 I went in to the local Democratic office to pick up an Obama yard sign. They offered me one for $5!. That was the first and last time I'll pay for political propaganda. The sign was promptly destroyed when somebody ran over it by driving into my yard, and by 2012 I'd have thrown it into the fire anyhow - a total loss in either case.

If the Hillary campaign posts the book online as a free PDF download I'll compose an actual review. Since I've researched the lady quite a bit over the past year, I seriously doubt if she'd like that review.

Format: Paperback
What a mess. I couldn't get through the whole thing it was not just boring, but simply about self grandizing. All they say over and over is how they are going to socialize America, and how hard working people are going to pay for it. It's nothing but a road map on converting this great country into communism. It was sickening and horrifying. Like a fiction novel on the end of the world doomsday. The scariest part is that if hiLIARy is elected, this book will go from fiction to documentary on the collapse of the United States.

Buy this book only if you want to waste money, listen to lies, and read the horrors of what is going to happen to America if hiLIARy is elected.

1.0 out of 5 starsStarts off pretty good, but so misleading
ByJim Hammondon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I read the initial free sample pages, and it is actually pretty good. Unfortunately it totally contradicts everything I have learned about Hillary Clinton from 1991 until yesterday, and thus I can only give it one star for such inaccuracy. Now, if Hillary had accurately described her previous character, and then explained why and how she was trying to redeem herself, I could have given it up to 5 stars.

Consider that I lived in the DC metro area from 1991 through 2005, and that I read the Washington Post and listened to NPR every day until about 1995. I have written over one hundred relevant articles under pseudonyms, and I've probably read 10,000 relevant articles, and had over 10,000 relevant conversations.

1.0 out of 5 starsPropaganda in it's purest form. The great dividers talk of being "stronger together"...BS
ByAdam C.on September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Crap written by a serial liar who isn't fit to govern the dog pound. The great dividers talk of being stronger together. Together as long as you don't have a dissenting opinion. If you don't agree with her dogma, you're the enemy and someone who needs their voice silenced, their rights trampled, their views vilified. "Together", as long as you're not accusing her husband of rape or some other abuse. "Together" as long as you're not asking what happened in Benghazi, or why General Petraeus was prosecuted for lesser crimes than Hillary committed. Save your money...it's better spent on dime store candy that this spin-rich drivel which isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

1.0 out of 5 starsLook at a wall instead
ByMagnabosson September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
A poorly-written book about a clown and a terrible person. I was forced to read this book by Mr. Vohs, and I am so mad at him for making us read this vomit inducing book about two people I would not let feed my dog. I watched "Clinton Cash" three weeks ago, and it's pretty clear that this book is nothing but baloney.

Just think about some of the far-better things you could be doing instead of reading this book.

- using the restroom
- sneezing
- looking at a wall
- sleeping

I have said my peace. Just my two cents. Remember what I said about looking at a wall.

Bydlynneon September 16, 2016

There is nothing new in this book, no fresh ideas or inspiration. Its page are just more of the same Hillary. The writing tries to be folksy, but when she talks about her personal life growing up, there is no interesting material, no interesting anecdote, that convincingly explains how and why she is where she is now. You can read this book in one sitting, although you will likely skim though, since most have heard it all before. I do not even know why Hillary wrote this book.

This book has lots of ideas with no practical way to pay for them. Hence, this is standard political propaganda offered to current followers. Saying you will simply get "others" to pay for them is standard are these days. As an aside, Jeff Bezos alledgedly manipulating review levels reminds me of Fahrenheit 451, the movie depicting the Nazi era where they burned books they believed were threatening.

I read the book and am glad i didnt actually have to pay for it. she left out the parts about how corrupt and dishonest she is. She failed to clarify how she earned her money while a government employee. Clinton has accomplished little in a 30 year carrer and iis the most corrupt dishonest person to run for president, after Bengazi, the email, the mishandling of classified information and all the other scandals she does not deserve to be honored with the office of the presidency.

I did not buy this book, I went to the local communist reading room to peruse its chapters. It is an epic achievement of cliches strung together with pabulum that insults the intelligence of a house plant. Neither witty, nor informative I believe that I have come away less informed than when I started. Quite the opposite of a page turner, I was forced to cut myself repeated to obtain the will to continue to slog through this. In the end, it was horrifying in aspect. I would not read this book; however, if in Venezuela there is a very useful thing that one might do with its pages.

1.0 out of 5 starsI was given this book by my Saudi friend
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
He said he bought a copy of it for $1.5mm, which I thought seemed a little high until he told me it came with one get out of jail free card... apparently that's a real thing.

Anyway I started reading it, but about three pages in I started coughing and then passed out. When I came to I found myself under what I thought was sniper fire... turned out it was just gas.

So I decided to pick up the book again but then I heard the strangest noise.... it was my husband diddling some bimbo in his office. So I decided to do what any reasonable person would... I started harassing her and had her life ruined.

Once that was finished I picked the book back up and read a few more pages but I had to leave to go meet my black friends. They were so mean to me that day they said I kept talking in some sort of "fake black southern accent". So I went home.

When I got home my husband said it was time for bed but I told him "I don't feel no ways tired" so I read some more. Well a few chapters in i didn't like what I was reading, and had a feeling that I shouldn't let anybody else read this so I had the book put in my bathroom closet. But I didn't think that was good enough so I hired some guy off of Craigslist to delete what was in the book. Turned out he didn't know how to, but he asked some people on Reddit and they helped him.

All in all this is a really weird book *cough*

Poorly written and inspiring, Hillary Clinton continues the fairytale (nightmare) while hardworking Americans struggle more than ever. Her plans laid out in this book will only continue to degrade the lives of families and society. She continues to divide America in her plan and rhetoric. Stronger Together isn't her real vision. The book is a sham just like she is.

If you look at hillarys measley 100's in her rallies, and there are THOUSANDS at TRUMPS RALLIES, yes, I guess you could say there are more DEEPLORABLES than you think. WE know the TRUTH about her, and will VOTE accordingly. Contrary to the RACIST tactics you all try to pull, we want our AMERICA Safe, Free, with GOOD JOBS, and not having to worry about ISIS, or the MEXICAN DRUGS coming in and killing our loved ones. We are SICK and TIRED of paying for every LEECH that wants free handouts, causing our taxes to skyrocket, while others sit and collect pennies, due to NO JOBS. We want the tax money we pay out to stay HERE. Charity begins at HOME, and AMERICA is our HOME!! We want our VETS and SENIORS taken care of for a change, instead of Sharia Law Loving MUSLIMS. We've had ENOUGH MUSLIM TERROIST MURDERS in AMERICA, and we want it STOPPED. We want RELIGION BACK!! We want to gain our Respect Back that we had before. We don't want a president that every time something happens, she says "What difference does it make?" We don't want a president that "apologizes" everywhere they go for stuff that the others did. We ant a PRESIDENT that will stand UP for us and NOT sell us out. We are ALL Races, Religions, Cultures, and economic status with one common goal, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. We ARE the DEPLORABLES!!

1.0 out of 5 starsNeither wrote this book
ByBGPon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
From the first pages I realized that neither of these people had written this book. A ghostwriter went through speeches and previous books and articles to pull together talking points. There seems to be nothing here that is new, nothing that cold be considered to be other than political drivel that get spewed out over campaign travel dates. I read hundreds of books a year, both fiction and non-fiction, good and bad. This one is fiction, non-fiction and bad. Other than to point out Kaine and Clinton are running for office, there seems to be no reason for the book. Even if all proceeds go to charity (Clinton Foundation?), it is a thinly-veiled attempt to garner votes.

ByJames Ciccarellion September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Well this is a second time trying to post a review. Bad Bezos!

A neighbor gave me his copy as he was moving. I think he said Cuba.
He used the term “idiot savants” to describe the effort Hillary and Kaine put into this book.

I have to admit, I picked thru the book as hastily as it was written. The book is a advanced form of lobotomy.
After this brief read, I believe that the Federal government has a duty to protect us from Hillary's phalanx of indelicate energumens. That's why all of us must criticize the obvious incongruities presented by her and her trained seal Kaine. If anything, education will free us from the shackles of their spiteful Marxist theories, the knowledge of the world as it really is sets us apart, as these savants have no inclining thought as to what reality is.

1.0 out of 5 starsLike everything else with her
ByCaptain Marvelon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
When would sick billary and Crooked Kaine have had time to write a 288-page book together? Like everything else with her, the book is a lie, the authorship is a lie, and it's deeply disturbing that they actually cut down a so many good trees to publish this garbage. . I enjoyed them immensely and thank the authors for hours of entertainment. No need to read the book because I'm not voting for Hillary, no way, no how. I don't even care what happens in the debates. Because, I am voting for Trump. But remember folks, unless the polls are as corrupt as Amazon corrupted her star-ratings, she is ahead in some key polls. Not by much but it only takes 1. So the thing is, we MUST get out and vote for Trump and if you can, please send his campaign money for ground game and ads. Please!!!! We must overcome the percentage of voter fraud so need more than 50 + 1 in order to win.

I looked forward to reading this book but, wanted up being disappointed. I was a firm believe in Mrs. Clinton and was planning on voting for her. Now, totally not. She does not know how to be honest. I find it disturbing that it has come down to this. Trump is not the best candidate, but he appears more truthful and has been factual and believable compared to Mrs. Clinton.

I listened to the audio version for as long as I could take it - with any volume at all she sounds like an owl screeching and out of breath. Hillary's monotone growling voice just bla bla bla mixed with trivial unimportant personal stories that are certainly conjured campaign lies about a boring liberal spoiled brat who sounds bored with herself. She should write a book on her health - call it "How I got a hole in my Tongue" or a exercise book called "Curing Cankles" with a chapter "How not to trip on a Stair Stepper".

This woman is nuts. Did anyone else notice that throughout the entire book, Hilary references herself dozens and dozens of times. Man is she stuck on herself or what.

1.0 out of 5 starsHopeless diatribe Not written, just assembled.
ByMike3746on September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I bought this, of all places, at my used book store! already? So, the price was right, 50 cents! I actually tried to read it. I wanted to find out what is in this "Team's mind" Clinton and Kaine. But, no luck. It is nothing but clips of campaign rhetoric and mundane editorial clips salivating over the Democrat party and Clinton. It has nothing of real political substance or factual information on either candidate. You will find all sorts of heart tugging platitudes, like a call for helping"children in wheel chairs" and "love and harmony" is thrown around a lot. But, there is absolutely nothing I could find about "How" to accomplish anything. It seems to be saying, "Vote for us, because we are nice and want to do 'the right thing". But, they never go into what they stand for, what their plans are, what they actually think about America's problems.

It's just a massive propaganda assembly. Like political ads and high praise and yet, no substance or depth what-so-ever.

If you are looking to learn something real about either of these two people who desire desperately to become President of the USA, (they never say why they want to be President and Veep, though...they just want it- Badly! ) you are wasting your money and your time. You will not find what you are looking for in this hopeless diatribe.

This book made no sense. The plot was incoherent and the main characters were unlikeable. I was hoping there would be a plot twist at the end that made it worth my time, but alas there was none to be found. Truth be told it reminded me of a propaganda pamphlet that distorts that truth to make someone look better than they are.

The better read would be Seven Principles of Good Government by Gary Johnson, who is coincidentally also running for President and will be on the ballot in all 50 states. #LetGaryDebate

1.0 out of 5 starsLiberalism is a Mental Disorder
ByTheTruthon September 25, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Wow, you really need to hit a new kind of stupid to actually believe and enjoy this book. The same tired, repetitive, rehashed progressive talking points and cliches of "working together", "get economy working for everyone", "talking to each other", "more free stuff" etc. They are all laughable in that her and the progressive strategy is the exact opposite. It's all about being divisive and dividing groups by race, gender, income, age, religion, etc. and pitting one against the other.

So, she says all of these things we need to do like another infrastructure stimulus!!, make the economy better, work together, etc. because things have gotten bad. YET, in her campaign she said Obama did a great job and she will continue his policies!!!!!!!!! Obama has been the president for 8 years, so, so, if it has been so great, then why are you saying we need to fix everything and even another trillion dollar infrastructure program!!! If the last 8 years were so bad that you need to fix everything, then why are you running on saying you will continue an Obozo third term???

Liberalism is truly a mental disorder.

5.0 out of 5 starsTHIS BOOK HELPED ME GET A GREAT JOB AND STARTED ON A NEW LIFE
ByDonny Brookon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Disclaimer: I didn't buy this book to read, in fact, I had a hard time getting past the photo on the cover when I first picked it up. But the reason I bought this book was because I decided to carry it along with me at a job interview I was scheduled to have at a local State University for a highly sought after position in their Facilities Department as an Operating Engineer. Being a 50 something male from middle class America I have come to the conclusion that my specific demographic represents something which the younger "social justice warrior" type millennials and/or liberal-progressive college administration types who might be responsible for hiring decisions--- just might put me at a distinct disadvantage in this job interview. At first I considered just wearing a tye-dyed shirt and flip flops, or not showering and grow a thick lumberjack beard and wear one of those knit caps like all those hipster kids are wearing today. However, eventually I decided that might be trying too hard for an old war horse like me, so I knew I needed to come up with something else, something to make just the right impression.

When I saw this Hillary Clinton book on the checkout counter at the supermarket next to copies of Cosmopolitan, National Inquirer and the cans of Red Bull-- a light bulb went off in my head. Hey I thought, what if I get this book and then use it to possibly get a leg up at my upcoming interview? I mean what could possibly give more warm fuzzies to a liberal college administrator with institutionalized radical bias than seeing a job applicant who shares their same underdeveloped critical thinking skills and an innate sense of entitlement well into adulthood? Worth a try I figured.

When I arrived at the interview I was worried that I might be overdressed in my business attire, especially when I saw the Human Resources director who was a '60s something woman with long wild grey hair, no make up, and wearing a muumuu and Birkenstock sandals. And when I walked into the office and the HR director looked up at me with a less than friendly look on her face like I had just clubbed a wounded dolphin in her presence... I thought oh boy I'm screwed now! I thought maybe I should have worn the tye-died shirt after all--- or at least not showered and shaved like she hadn't that day. However, when I opened my briefcase to hand the woman my resume (strategically leaving the case open with Hillary's book in view) the interview seemed to go really well after that point; I even think the old hippie grandma even smiled a couple of times at me. And I have to admit, I was just really relieved that she didn't ask me anything specific about Hillary's book--- because I hadn't read a word of it! BTW who the heck is Tim Kaine anyway? Is that Hillary's IT guy?

Well, I can't say how happy I was that Hillary Clinton's book helped me out in landing a great job. I really doubt that Donald Trump's book could done nearly as much for me. The next day I was so inspired by the whole experience that I recycled the book in a newfound sense of global environmental responsibility. I guess people really can be changed for the better after all.

Thank You Hillary Clinton!!

ByKiley Andersonon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Nothing in this book can be believed. The woman is a pathological liar. Every time she opens her yap another whopper flies out. On top of that, she let 4 brave Americans die in Bebghazi and when questioned about it she said "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?" She is truly the definition of a horrible human being. Oh, did I mention she illegally used a private, non-secure email server to send classified state department business emails while she was Secretary of State and that despite overwhelming evidence of her guilt the justice department is so corrupt they didn't even take it to a grand jury? How corrupt can you get? Oh, and rhe book is nothing but left wing drivel. If you're even moderately intelligent you'll be disgusted and possibly even nauseated.

1.0 out of 5 starsCEO Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Owner of the Washington Post believes it is okay to change the truth for his personal benefit.
ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Disappointing to read in the public news today that Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, thinks it is appropriate to prevent freedom of Speech on reviews of Hillary Clinton's book because he disagrees with the negative reviews. The Amazon Board should fire him immediately as this is so inappropriate to do within a public company or any company for that matter. If a cake baker losses their company for their believes, Mr. Bezos should lose his CEO role at Amazon for his belief that preventing freedom of speech is okay by changing it. If all current Amazon customers who are frustrated with this action and express public outrage over Mr. Bezos actions including their wilingness to stop using Amazon I think it would have a significant impact on Amazon and the Board would have to considering removing him. Brian Williams learned the hard way when you try to play games with the public. Considering Mr. Bezos owns the Washington Post as well, it makes a clear statement that they don't believe in true reporting either.

Blatant exaggeration, misdirection, and the persistent assertion of manufactured "facts" blended with the foolish notion that we, as a country, are awash with money such that the endless supply of free stuff to the "takers" is eminently possible. This drivel is impossible to finish. The really scary thing is that the good reviewers can likely vote. Don't leave this around where the under-educated and under-employed might find it.

This is simply a terrible book. Jeff Bezos is a fool for attempting to protect Hilary Clinton through his unethical deletion of reviews. I will no longer be shopping on Amazon and encourage all other level headed Americans not to as well.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe Art of Lying and Deception
ByJohn Jacksonon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Crooked Hillary is a super predating traitor against us all. She's the face of the corrupt Democratic Party. The entire party leadership should be banished from participating in the U.S. political process for life. In addition, all of them who perpetrated crimes should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Stealing the Presidential election of the U.S. should be regarded as high treason.

Too bad amazon doesn't allow zero stars, or even negative stars. The "author" is incapable of telling the truth, so why would anyone buy her book? You can't even use the pages as toilet paper; you'd probably end up with a rash, or pneumonia, or some neurological disorder. I hope they didn't print too many of these; getting rid of all the unsold copies will contribute to global warming.

“Income and wealth inequality in America today has reached levels not seen since the 1920s. Corporate”
― Hillary Rodham Clinton, Stronger Together

.“We cannot demonize, demagogue, and declare war on an entire religion…Hate is not the answer to hate.” ~ Hillary Clinton, June 13th 2016

Trump wants to cut taxes for the super-rich. Well we’re not going there, my friends. I’m telling you right now, we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class.”
Hillary Clinton, August 1, 2016 Audio and/or video clip available

“We need to get that dog and follow them around and every time they say these things like, 'Oh, you know, the Great Recession was caused by too much regulation,' arf, arf, arf, arf!”
Hillary Clinton, February 15, 2016 Audio and/or video clip available

Noticed a number of this things... 1) What you don't talk about is just as important as what you do say. 2) Just because you say it does not make it so. 3) Glaring disconnect from the reality I've been observing and living the last 8 years. 4) Charts a course that dos not benefit the working American. Who the heck does she think is going to pay for these ideas?

1.0 out of 5 starsHILLARY FOR PRISON 2016
ByGregg D. Armstrongon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
This tripe, allegedly written by KKK (Klinton Krime Klan) leader Hillary Clinton and her Jesuit Liberation Theology partner in crime, is a colossal waste of paper and digital storage space. They should have just written about their true intentions:

"We are going to do whatever the Banking Gangsters who pay our bribes tell us to do."

See how simple it should have been. The only thing about Hillary Clinton that I'm interested in reading about is when she's sentenced to a Federal SuperMax prison for high crimes and misdemeanors and other Federal felonies.

Hillary Clinton did perform one very valuable public service with this tripe. Amazon.com's deletion of thousands of unflattering reviews has publicly exposed crony capitalist Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com as loyal card-carrying members of the Feral government's organs of state propaganda (mainstream media & entertainment oligopoly). Jeff Bezos' The Washington Post is another Feral government organ of state propaganda (mainstream media & entertainment oligopoly) tool that is 100% in the bag for Hillary Clinton's totalitarian agenda for the United States of America.

5.0 out of 5 starsIf you don't love this book you're a sexist millennial Russian spy!
ByJWon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I mean come on folks! It's the Most Qualified Book Ever! It's a Progressive that Gets Things Done, yet it also pleads guilty to being kind of centrist and moderate. It will teach you how to love the TPP, sell fracking around the world, rake in millions from bankers and dictators, and kiss Henry Kissinger without vomiting in your mouth! Sadly, however, it will not teach you how to keep your husband on the porch or follow federal records retention rules. But what kind of basket of deplorables would complain about a few little "short circuits" in this awe-inspiring masterpiece of soul-searing honesty? Truly this book deserves five stars and then some. And I am brave enough to stand up as the one lone voice of truth and award those stars! By the way, I would have written this review sooner but I was dodging sniper fire in Bosnia.

Our Country has been falling apart under the leadership of Barrack Obama, and I think it'll get worse if Hillary Clinton is elected. I've never seen people of our country so racially divided in my whole life. We are all citizens of this great Nation, and we should be treated equally regardless of skin color. Right now protests in Charlotte are going on for 5 days now. People are burning businesses and tearing up the communities. The Democrats have been hijacked by activists, and are ripping this Nation apart, it's time to have policies that aren't divisive, no more quotas, no more affirmative action, no more segregation. Let us all get along, we are all the same.

I tried unsuccessfully several times to read this awful book after checking it out from my local library. Several days later, I set the book down and fell asleep, leaving the book somewhere that I can't recall. When the librarian asked me to pay a fine for the lost book, I told her that I didn't intend to lose it, that I couldn't recall where I had put it, that I really wasn't even aware that library books are meant to be returned to the library, and what difference did it make anyway? She said that it was ok and the library would decline to pursue reimbursement for the book.

Just purchased this book Friday night.

It was an OK read. But the thing that really bothers me is that it is basically an unobtainable agenda written once again to promise the world to the members of society that are looking for someone to be their ticket to free bennies.

Time for Hillary to open her eyes, take responsibility for her actions and tell the truth.
This books is a propaganda narrative, similar to what is heard in the strong man republics of S. America.

1.0 out of 5 starsZERO STARS - book is just a rehash of old failed policies that will take us further down the Obama Administration rabbit hole
ByGreggon September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback
Here goes my second review - Amazon removed my first critical review - so I'm writing another, and I'll keep writing them if Amazon continues to removes them, but this time, I'll write the review and save it - so next time it is a cut and paste job. So - here it goes... This book is really a waste of money if you buy it, and time if you read it. Even the Washington Post says: "WaPo warns: Hillary's 'Stronger Together' is 'a deplorable campaign book'. The book is just very repetitive and hard to read. It also makes it clear that Clinton is basically for the same thing that Obama is for. There is nothing original in this book. Given the serious economic peril our Nation faces - the fact that Clinton has to plan to address these problems is dire, and the book makes this plainly apparent. I wanted to give the book no stars, but that is not an option.

ByTrader Jackon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I was waiting expectantly for this book to arrive, but apparently the copy in our local library is defective. It is missing some very important chapters:

1. How to obtain a job delivering $250,000 half-hour speeches. My friends and family all agree I have a more engaging personality than Ms Clinton, plus I would have my dog perform tricks at no extra charge. I cannot find a single gig for a $250,000/speech job and was eagerly waiting on the book for information on how to do this.

2. IT and Technology tips. I would like to know how to run a major enterprise out of a public toilet. This could really reduce overhead at my firm and might lead to some $250,000 speaking jobs.

3. How to beat a Federal criminal investigation. One can never tell when this might come in handy.

4. Health and beauty tips.

I have attached pictures of some better Clinton books.

ByGary D. Scotton September 16, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I am not a Democrat and walked away from the Democrat Lite party called Republicans over 20 years ago. I purchased this book to read what Hillary and Tim Kaine claim to have in store for the American public if voted into the highest and most powerful office in the land. The expression of their dream did not take long. In fact it was expressed by Hillary right in the introduction. She describes her encounters with wheelchair bound and lunch-less children “on my first job after law school.” She says it became clear to her that “simply caring is not enough, but to drive real progress you MUST CHANGE HEARTS and (absent that working) LAWS.”

Unfortunately a lawyer-politician I have never met forcing my “heart” and “creating laws” to suit her ends is not my idea of a good or even mediocre president of the United States of America, defender of freedom, justice or liberty. I do not try (nor want) to change or force Hillary’s heart, her suspicious at best “ends justify the means” methods, and certainly do not feel the need to vote for a team and their unelected bureaucracy who would impose their ideas of same on me. Would I ask to be taxed, coerced, threatened with law breaking penalties and bureaucratically regulated to suit Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton’s progressive culture changing ends and intentions? No. Thanks anyway, I’ll pass.

The rest of the 249 plus pages of flowery prose is a professionally written tax and spend tear jerking blueprint of the supposed utopia she and Tim will create. By changing hearts and laws. Curiously I did not encounter the words “liberty”, “self determination”, “freedom”, choice, association or words like them anywhere in this book.

So (apologies to Amazon’s rating system) for accuracy and information learned right from the horses mouth (or ghost writer’s word processor) I am forced gave Stronger Together 5 stars.

1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon manipulated reviews for this God-awful book.
ByEric Blairon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Hillary's "plan" for America is one centered on destruction of the very things that has made America a tremendous success story. Her plan for America is destroying our reputation abroad, making us less safe and destroying what is left of our economy by inciting class warfare and disincentivizing hard work and innovation via punishing taxation and over-regulation.

It's funny that a firmly capitalism-reliant company like Amazon would be so heavily invested in manipulating reviews to help promote the sale of a book that promotes a collectivist economic ideology. It's truly disappointing that Amazon has been caught red-handed deleting hundreds of negative reviews for this God-awful piece of garbage. Jeff Bezos is a dedicated Hillary supporter and that's his right to support whatever candidate he chooses. However, the manipulation of reviews by his company is both pathetic and indicative of modern liberal ideology that cannot tolerate a free exchange of ideas and perspectives.

Found the chapter, "Rapist Enabling for Dummies" second only to "Laundering Money from Foreign Governments" on the fascination scale. And if you'd like to get something about her campaign over in video, just check-out, "Weekend at Bernie's."

1.0 out of 5 starsTedious reading...with an obvious tone
ByR. MAYERon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I can honestly claim I read this book...albeit a somewhat painful experience. If you're the least bit insightful and objective, any reader will quickly sense the tone and aura of this near propaganda. I'm truly sorry I paid for this book, and will place more importance on future Amazon ratings. btw, fakespot.com continues to provide a real service in validating Amazon reviews.

ByB. Clintonon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
My wife read it cover-to-cover. Afterwards I asked many questions about the book. I found that she had no recollection of anything she had read. What was the title? Can't remember. Was there any classified information in the book? Can't remember. Any mention of Benghazi? Can't remember. Email servers? Can't remember. Very worried about my wife's mental capacity these days. Lots of coughing and passing out as well...

Thought maybe she should read it again, but what difference at this point does it make...

1.0 out of 5 starsKaine and Unable
Byallanwolon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
She is a bigoted pathological liar. Nothing in this book makes sense or is verifiably true - it is astounding that someone allowed this book to go into print. Criminal globalists - attempting to pulverise the world's populations with poverty and squalor at the same time stealing billions (like from Haiti) to line their own pockets. They are without conscience or shame which profoundly advertises their sociopathic behaviour and pathologic enterprises. The Clinton Criminal Syndicate is just expanding like cancer, and Kaine is a mindless, stooge that is on board for his greedy desires. They make a good pair, evidenced by the rubbish they have put together in this book - did they even write it? - Kaine and Unable.

1.0 out of 5 starsOther politicians look like saints next to these evil-doers
ByJames Sweatton September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
To call these two authors is greatly stretching. To even call them human beings is a stretch. Other politicians look like saints next to these evil-doers. Steer clear if you care about the truth. If you like your communist propaganda with a side of chutzpah, you'll love this book. I still suggest waiting until after the election to read this drivel as it will be in the bargain bin and libraries will be giving them away.

1.0 out of 5 starsThis reads like the modern day Communist Manifesto
ByRevon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Well, I'm an open-minded person who truly wanted to know what the candidates stood for - so I got the book. This reads like the modern day Communist Manifesto. The first few pages are positive, affirming, and put America in a good light. The remainder of the book seems to be written by policy wonks, intent on changing the nation they first called "good!" The "plans" are long on regulation, who will oversee, what will be required by the elitists, should America be foolish enough to elect them. But, the book is just as short on any hint of what benefit might be gotten, or how the plan might actually be implemented - except to call Congress do-nothings and obstructionists.

I see a lot of comments from people who say they read a bit...then skimmed. That temptation is great because this is not an engaging book. It's a policy lecture. What little explanation is done on any given topic, is only meant to strong-arm the reader into believing that Clinton's way is the only "right" way. Frankly, it gets incredibly annoying after the first couple of iterations.

If you want a Queen and a Chancellor, this book makes the perfect case for Clinton/Kaine. If you'd prefer a democratic republic, they do a great job of convincing you they're not the best choice.

So I came here, laughed about all the reviews, saw the evidence, then I thought, okay, I'm here, I'm going to shop around - signed into my account and it wouldn't recognize my password - which I use weekly - So I click "forget password?", got my email code, and began creating a new password - I used the EXACT same password I had before, or at least what I thought it was - and Amazon said I couldn't use that! LOL, so I changed it a bit and had to come here and tell everyone about Amazon and their 1984 Memory Hole!!! Guess what Amazon - i'll never spend a penny with you again. crooks. Oh yea, so I'm an OIF Vet, so what you don't care, but we are one big family, I'll just sign into facebook after this and let all my buddies know what you're up to.

Clinton does only one thing well: lie; Like all demoncraps, she professes to love blacks, but in reality only expects their animal devotion; she is all in for abortion, and most aborted foetuses, by far, are negroes, as negroes cannot control their animal impulses.
Hillary projects herself as populist, but in truth she is totally elitist, feeling herself far above everyone else.

3.0 out of 5 starsAn indexed collection of talking points
ByDavid P. Perkinson September 24, 2016
Format: Audible Audio Edition|Verified Purchase
If you were hoping that this book was an opportunity for in-depth analysis of complex issues, for the candidates to show that they understand complexity and demonstrate how they manage and navigate it, you're going to be disappointed.

The book is actually a giant FAQ, with each entry receiving a 1-2 page response. Since each entry is meant to stand alone it's highly repetitive, often word for word and in close proximity. Because each entry is meant to be consumed quickly, there isn't much detail.

If, for whatever reason, you need an indexed collection of talking points close at hand then this is the book for you. Otherwise, it's not.

1.0 out of 5 starsTheir chain is missing a few links!
ByEdward Lopezon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I bought this book even though I read most of the reviews here. It is a well-written book but I highly doubt that Clinton and Kaine wrote it. If Clinton and Kaine had really written it, every page would contain more bs than it does. But the pair knows that bs sells and they oblige. Clinton and Kaine are the worst America and if elected we will all be annihilated except them, of course, when they are taken to a safe place until it's okay to breathe the air. They are first class liars and nothing in the book supports the title. Their individual achievements as laid out in the book would make a great horror story.

You have to make up your mind but I'm sure that the contents of this book will sour you on even giving it as a gift. I predict that the majority of buyers will discard this book as it leaves a bad taste in your mouth as you find out what bs tastes like.

Disappointing that Bezos is consumed with elitist know it all to the point that he willingly attempted to mislead his customers by removing a majority of the negative reviews and leaving the 5 star. These tech big wigs are too big for their britches. Next they will be telling us outright that they have the right to dictate to Americans who their potus will be. They need some competition. Up and coming coming techies step up and take it away from them. They have run out of creative juice anyway.

BynateBostonon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump go into a bakery.
As soon as they enter the bakery, Hillary steals three pastries and puts them in her pocket.
She says to Donald, "See how clever I am? The owner didn't see anything and I don't even need to lie.” I will definitely win the election.
The Donald says to Hillary, "That's the typical dishonesty you have displayed throughout your entire life, trickery and deceit. I am going to show you an honest way to get the same result."
Donald goes to the owner of the bakery and says, "Give me a pastry and I will show you a magic trick." Intrigued, the owner accepts and gives him a pastry. Trump swallows it and asks for another one. The owner gives him another one. Then Donald asks for a third pastry and eats that, too.
The owner is starting to wonder where the magic trick is and asks, "What did you do with the pastries?" Trump replies, "Look in Hillary's pocket".

I bought this book and put it on my bookshelf to read at a later date. Well, I guess the books around it saw something they weren't supposed to see, and they are all dead now. Looks like bookicide, but I highly suspect several were pushed off the shelf and fell to their death on the floor. I can't prove it and the other books aren't saying a thing. I am going to have to keep an eye on this book. Sigh, now it's coughing and won't stop, how annoying.

I think Tim Kaine must be holding Hillary up on the cover of that book. Obviously nobody is holding her up on the inside of this book.

These people are terminally ill and just in denial. Donald Trump is correct when he says "the system is rigged." Rigged for him. She may not even make to election day in any kind of health. I have seen her symptoms before.

I have no problem with a Woman being President, but can we get one that does not have crazy pathological eyes and a really bad case of Granny Butt! If you have not noticed they are trying to pass her off with younger pics in her ads. Sorry Hillary you look like a beat up old lady. I recommend plenty of rest and a Priest.

1.0 out of 5 starsUtter and complete rubbish; Ghost written by illiterates!
ByAmazon Customeron September 16, 2016
Format: Paperback
Utter and complete rubbish; ghost written by an illiterate!

'The Plan' is nothing less than the death knell of the Republic, the elimination of the Constitution and Bill of Rights as we know it, and the imposition from the top down of Progressive Socialism as a tool for the Controllers, Masters, Owners and Elitists (along with their salad tossing stooges) to finally solidify control of the greatest force for good the world has ever produced.

DO read the book. They lay it all out right there and aren't shy about it. Oh, you have to decode the ProgTard vocabulary, but they are laughingly rubbing your nose in their plans.

They HATE the middle class, minorities, the military and small business owners. HATE THEM. Their plans are to deconstruct, marginalize and gain control over all these groups... and they say so right here...

Aside from the content, the actual production and editing of the book is also miserable. You'd think for your election manifesto you'd pay for top class rewrite and editing... but no. It's like it was just a check box to do and screw, because they new most copies would end up in US Embassy waiting rooms in 5th world crap holes, USDA cafeterias propping up broken table legs and being used to start the diesel up in s***e burn barrels..

The lying enabling bitch in the Mao pantsuit can only make America great again by keeling over dead (again) at tomorrow's debate. Slimy Bill won't be far behind her. Sadly that is the only way the Clinton Crime Syndicate will be stopped. Even then the multitude of their fellow corpse voters will likely make this a close election.

1.0 out of 5 starsHRC has lieiabetes
ByKnuckledraqgeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
One world order, open borders, socialism, along with corruption and having a associate of the Muslim Brotherhood as her right hand person shows that HRC is a trader. Read the emails she deleted that goes all the way to the top. Obama emailed her several times on her clitonmail.com sever but he lied that he only found out about her sever in the newspaper. What he wrote was redacted by the FBI because it was confidential information, thus ALL are guilty of " NOT TAKING CARE" and lying . There is no such thing as intent needed to prosecute for exposing state secrets. Obama, Hillary and the rest are a mix of subversives with corruption bent only on bringing the USA to its knees to join the one world government movement and to fill their bank accounts to live the privilege life. If this person is the next POTUS it will lead to being attacked from enemy states because of our much weaken military state that she will continue to cut along with her neurological problems. The worst though is that civil war may be looming to remove the entire DC government who for the most part are seen as all being corrupt or subversive. These people in power on both sides of the fence are scared to death that Trump will be the POTUS because he doesn't carry the baggage of lobbyist, corporations and big donors and he will open up investigations of all departments and remove all of the lackeys and subversives of the progressives movement along with Islamist who have infiltrated every branch of government. The combination of the progressives trying for one world order and Islamist trying to change our country from Christion to Islam has divided our country. Islam is a theocracy that subverts any other ideals or religion by the threat of death or death out right if your a Jew. This is why the middle east has been held back so far in innovations and moving into the present. Saudi Araba still teaches in their schools that every religion in the world must be removed by any means possible and HRC takes money from them and that's where HRC's Huma Abedin's parents live and put out the Muslim Brotherhoods messages of hate. This book is nothing but garbage not fit to be used to line a bird cage.

2.0 out of 5 starsA Must Read for A Better, Bolder America
ByIcejonon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
From the cover till the last page this book has delivered uncompromising value. First two thirds of this book consists of previously undisclosed material, that have been very helpful in my daily life. The first chapters are all on yoga positions, including my favorite contortion: the lying puppy. The girth of the book includes wedding planning tips, and empty quotations from Bill Clinton. My favorite chapter of the book is titled "failing upwards", and it consists of tips on how to reset relationships with Russia.

The most practical chapter is on the topic of improving security in Libya. Buried in the end of this chapter is a chilling transcript of "The innocence of Muslims". After reading, I felt inspired to riot for no good reason at all.

I've grown better, stronger and wiser after reading this book. I encourage everyone to purchase this book before its launch in the 99 Cents Only store. I wish every country could have a leader as excellent at yoga, wedding planning and foreign policy as Bill Clinton.

1.0 out of 5 starsI like the "spirit of understanding" conveyed, but it doesn't applaud the political awaress of the american peoples
ByResearcheron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I really like the noble ideas regarding unity in this book and agree that this country needs "the spirit of understanding" if we are to remain strong. I also agree that racism is an enemy to all of us.

However I am concerned about political rhetoric, since truth and follow-through are matters of record that define a person, their team and agendas. I struggle with the contrast of these needed "ideals" and the absence of openness regarding accountability and truth in public office. (Not hit hard enough in the book)

My biggest concern is that untrue, unaccountable politicking has allowed an elite and separated class of people to grow in power and corruption. This is not well addressed either. Rebellion of public officials to the “rule of the people” was glossed over as well. Cronyism and elitism are historically among the most destructive forms of racism.

Summary: I am left with the impression of a ghost written hypocritical politicking “story” that fails to realize the eyes of the American people are opened to elitist racism.

1.0 out of 5 starsYes We Are Stronger Together To Rid Our Nation Of This Embarrassment.
ByMichael Ledermanon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Alas it was riveting in a vulgar sort of way, page after page of false information, stories that skipped over facts we've all known for years.My take on this is that while Yes we are indeed "Stronger Together" one must look at it a different way. We must remain strong and we should be out To Get Her. Return Hillary Clinton who has a penchant for low moral men including her husband and Vice Presidential pick who was so proud of his "open marriage" that he wrote about it, to the footnote of history where she should have remained.

1.0 out of 5 starsHillary good at complaining about problems, but after 30 years she still has no solutions
Bygjton September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
Many, if not most, of what she says is just untrue. She also never specifies exactly what she will do to fix all the problems. Hillary has been in national politics for over 30 years and she has never done anything and the book reflects it. Unfortunately, the book does not explain what the heck she has been doing for the past 30 years and why hasn't she fixed anything during those 30 years. Hillary does not say why or how she would now fix what she has been unable to do for the previous 30 years. Terrible book, do not buy it.

1.0 out of 5 stars... link to fact checking sites since half of the crap in it was spun to make Hillary look like ...
ByMiss. Anne Thropeon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book was written at a 9th grade level and should electronically link to fact checking sites since half of the crap in it was spun to make Hillary look like a hero when the truth paints her in a far worse light. I particularly enjoyed the part of the book where she slams her Nazi-saluting running mate, Tim Kaine, whom she had to reward with the VP slot after he was incentivized to step down as the leader of the DNC so that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz could come in and rig the elections for Hillary. Clinton actually called him unfit, but hey, look at him now! When you do a favor for Hillary Clinton you get rewarded generously unless of course she doesn't appreciate your work and then you're unceremoniously murdered by "suicide". I will not be saving this book or even donating it to Goodwill for fear that others will be subjected to the nightmares that I had after consuming this book. I will be adding this book to my compost pile in the hopes that the worms who eat it can make something decent out of the wasted paper this book used. Do yourself a favor, don't read this propaganda. Turn off the MSNBC and CNN and start thinking for yourself before it's too late.

A co-worker was so insistent that I give Hillery's new book a try. He promised if I read just the first few pages I'd understand why Hillery is our nation's only hope.

Well after 10 pages of pure BS propaganda written by a perpetual liar, my nausea and vomiting rose to an uncontrollable fit. Least to say, the only thing this "book" is good for is using the pages as TP during emergencies. However I'd advise that doing so may result in very bad rashes and skin diseases developing in the areas which make contact with its tainted pages.

When I started to read I was gonna give her the benefit of the doubt. It was poorly written and seemed more like she was trying to convince herself than the audience of he qualifications. I could write how her career has had more failures then success. From her performance during the Watergate investigation. The fact that she couldn't control her husband and his affairs. Of the fact that she really wasn't qualified to sec of state. But hey I quess its not about what you know but who you know as long as you are a white women. Funny how she and her husband claimed they were broke when he left office. Yet the can buy million dollar homes, and start foundation's. I wish I could recommend this book but I can't. The more I read the more I could imagine the chains of oppression being forged by her policy's. Save your money. But if you have to get a copy, buy it when you go camping that way if you run out TP you have something to wipe your bum or start a fire

1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon sells out to DNC
ByJason Shaufon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Dear Amazon, STOP pandering to Hillary Clinton and let peer reviews that do not violate your terms stand.

Four days ago (the morning of Sept 19) there were 898 reviews of this book. By evening there were 983 reviews. The reviews were merciless and many quite funny (though mostly accurate). This morning I look and there's 209 reviews. Hmmmmm, what happened to all those other reviews? Apparently Clinton has friends at Amazon.

Edited to add: In the WND article there was a comment " This may be the first book to receive more reviews than sales" and I think that's possible. Meanwhile Hillary is laughing all the way to the bank. First she gets an $8 million dollar advance from Simon and Schuster for her last abysmal failure and now she's getting somewhere around $14 million for this book. The woman could hustle Bernie Madoff.

For one thing there was zero way that Hillary and Tim wrote this book in two months sense the Democratic convention. The book is a means to get around the election funding restrictions and a way to provide money to the candidates personally. Pro Hillary groups will be 1000s of copies of this book. Watch the prices will drop to $0.01 after the election. When thing this book shows is that Hillary is amazing at making money for herself and family.

1.0 out of 5 starsElection propaganda at its worst
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
A friend who is a liberal give me this book the other day. I'm an independent voter in PA, and haven't made up my mind so I decided to take a look. I was surprised that someone like Clinton who's even in public office for decades has so few real accomplishments to her name. Can anyone really name a single things she's accomplished as first lady, senator or secretary of state that's been a rousing success? This book alludes to the fact that she's been a champion of causes like women's rights and protecting the American workers, but frankly it is sobering that she's got nothing to show for all those years she put in. This is propaganda pure and simple. I wouldn't recommend buying it.

1.0 out of 5 starsIts sad that our country has come to support big government
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
A friend gave me this book, as I try to stay on both sides of the political isle, it lays out a plan of taking from as many different forms of American freedoms to give to those who don't want to work and get free handouts. Its sad that our country has come to support big government, without seeing the consequences. We will be taxed into prison. When the hardworking American cannot pay their taxes, what will happen. Everyone will stop working. Will the government come throw all of those people in prison for not be able to pay taxes. What about all the freeloaders who get the handouts? They will be the ones to come arrest everyone? The future is bleak in this county if Hillary wins, I pray for all of us.

1.0 out of 5 starsGhost Written Propaganda
ByStanger 07on September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I don't understand how two candidates running for the highest offices in the land could possibly have had time to write this book in little more than a month. Years of observing politicians has made me very cynical regarding their words and deeds. Sworn affidavits from Clinton and Kaine should be included as part of each book stating that the candidates are in fact the actual authors. Knowing that this will not be the case, I dismiss this book as a blatant propaganda piece no doubt ghost written by the candidates' speechwriters/propagandists.

Truly a poorly written, confusing piece of work. I tried to have an open-mind reading this, but it is clear that Hilary is not about America. She is about Hilary and wants to grab more and more power without regard to who she hurts or steps on. Also, if you care at all about the Constitution, you should really take a close look at her and her beliefs. She is SCARRRYYYY!!!

I once thought Amazon was the #1 Trusted company in America, and with this I think I would place them in the other basket of deplorable's along with CNN and all those other lying propagandist. Full disclosure, I did not purchase this book, however I did read the reviews, it was great comedy!

1.0 out of 5 starsShould be classified is the humor section
ByRusson September 26, 2016
Format: Audible Audio Edition
I was going to read this book … I really was. But just as I got started, I found myself under sniper fire, passed out, and fell and hit my head. After that I got double vision and had to wear glasses that were so damn thick I couldn’t even see to read. As if that wasn’t enough, I then had an allergic reaction to something and started coughing so hard I spit out what looked like a couple of lizard’s eyeballs, my limbs locked up, and I passed out and fell down again, waking up only to find out I had been diagnosed with pneumonia 2 days earlier. Somehow I managed to power through it all, but it’s a good thing I was able to make a small fortune on this random small trade in the commodities market (cattle futures or some such thing) and then, miracle of all miracles, a few banks offered me a few million to just talk to their employees for a few minutes – and all that really helped out because I swear I was dead broke and couldn’t figure out how I was gonna come up with the 6 bucks to pay for this book, let alone pay the $1,500 for my health insurance this month. I still want to read it, but, honestly, what difference at this point does it make? I hear it sucks anyway.”

1.0 out of 5 starsThese seem like strange ideals
ByTitus Andronicuson October 1, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
It reads as if it was written by consultants. It makes a lot of promises, but nothing very concrete and nothing very specific. There is little if any description of how the goals set forward in the book will be achieved.

I have difficulty understanding the rationale for certain sections. Why, for instance, is NAFTA and Clinton's criminal justice reform criticized (obliquely) in section 1, while George W. Bush's suggestions for gun policy are praised in section 3? Why, also, do the authors champion their own objectives for Puerto Rico rather than acknowledge island's right to self-determination? These seem like strange ideals, for the Democratic nominee.

I honestly don't know if I understand Clinton's platform any better than I did before I read the book.

After reading this book it is no wonder she deleted all her emails. Why would anyone put so much effort into sounding exactly like Hitler?

-Building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
*Hitler's economic stand
-Making the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, including infrastructure, manufacturing, clean energy, and small business.
*It says since WWII, because Hitler was the biggest investment prior to WWII
-Making debt-free college a reality and tackling the student debt crisis.
*Again Hitler's dream
-Defeating ISIS, strengthening our alliances, and keeping our military strong.
*Still sounding like Hitler, just added ISIS in the front
-Breaking down the barriers that hold Americans back by reforming our broken immigration system, ending mass incarceration, protecting voting rights, and fixing our campaign finance system.
*Damn if Hitler do the same thing
-Putting families first through universal, affordable health care; paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care.
*....Hitler much?! And her stance on abortion.... Shared view as our favorite mustachioed dictator

First off I am only giving this one star because Amazon does not have a negative star to offer. I purchased this book to try to better understand why so many people seem to ignore the facts and support Hillary. I thought maybe there was something I was missing. Maybe I was wrong about her. Well? Nope. This book is barely readable. Just horrible from beginning to end. Hillary's vision for America is for everyone to bow before her. Hillary believes she knows what you need better than you do.

5.0 out of 5 starsA solid recommendation
ByThe Buzzon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I find this book to be scintillating. Just as Hillary was the greatest Secretary of State since Dulles (making Kissinger look like an amateurish academic in the process), she has set a new standard for American literature. Imagine a disciplined Faulkner writing non-fiction or Bonfire of the Vanities (the novel NOT the motion picture) written with an intent to more closely analyze the phenomena of the media rather than to chronicle the results and you can appreciate the genius of this book. As an analytically political tome it does rival De Toqueville. I certainly believe it will read by millions and vecime a classic. Just as Hillary is the most examined and fully transparent politician of her generation yet remains remote and unfamiliar to most, so it is with this masterful book. Once it is read (hopefully when she become President it will be required reading) it will be ranked among the most outstanding literature of all time. I have personally bought 240 copies ad Holiday presents for friends and family. I highly recommend this book!

1.0 out of 5 starsThis book should have been deleted, not the reviews.
ByAnthony Newtonon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Adding a 1 star review to make up for one of the many that Amazon DELETED. Amazon's CEO is in the tank for Hillary, and the disdain for what us peons actually think about Hillary and her platform is staggering. That's why Amazon's CEO, Bezos, had the negative reviews removed.

The original review had all the standard complaints about this book and the lies therein, but I don't feel like recreating it so Amazon can just delete it again.

I'd give this book negative stars if I could.

I was given this book to read by a friend who is A Democrat and he thought the book stunk. FINALLY we have something to agree on. I've never read a more childish or pollyanish treatment of difficult issues in my entire life. Don't waste your vote or your money. I suppose my review also will be cleared from the list by the Bezos police, but at least I got this off my chest

1.0 out of 5 starslike so many other publications from her
ByJames Henryon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
The book is well written in that it is understandable and organized.

The content is scary. This, like so many other publications from her, is simply a dressed-up introduction to socialism.

That being said the socialist concepts introduced in this book sound deceivingly good to many people. Equality for all.... Free or low cost medical and social services...Free post-secondary education...But the truth is that the idea goes sour VERY quickly once it is realized that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The White House lawn isn't being planted for money-bearing trees. Ask all the voters that were big fans of "Obamacare" and are now being penalized at tax season because they don't qualify for this Obamacare and can't afford their own.

So many sheep....

Format: Paperback
I actually read this book, with the interest that someone would give a car accident as they pass it on the road. I gave it two stars because it is made out of nice paper and has a color cover. On a serious note, I can sum this book up in a few sentences. Every proposal is to take from the folks who have worked hard and give it to others. The 65% estate tax is just a start. Clinton's gone off the deep end in an attempt to rally the extreme left.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy." - Alexander Tytler

1.0 out of 5 starsSounds Nice But Not Workable
ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Borrowed a copy and read a lot of it before deciding I'd had enough. Though they try to make it sound nice, there's much too much socialism involved. Study history. Socialism has NEVER worked well and never will. Redistribution of people's money is a huge incentive killer and the antithesis of what made this country great.
The programs outlined in this book would be very, very expensive. Either taxes will greatly rise, consumer products will cost substantially more and/or our federal deficit will explode even more than Obama's record breaking rate. There's no such thing as a free lunch.
The cost of Hillary's programs would vastly exceed the benefits. No question. I just hope our society won't have to re-learn these lessons the hard way.

Her words seemed just as shallow & meaningless on paper. Explain to me... "Why would you delete e-mails after being instructed NOT to if there was NOTHING TO HIDE?" I expect more from a president. I expect someone who will own up to their mistakes instead of pointing fingers.The book was no better than "meaningless attempts to buy votes." I expect More!. {I am also a single home owner and supporting my 90 yr old father. I pay $560 a month for health insurance yet I can't afford to go to a doctor for fear of them finding something wrong with me as I can't afford the $6,000 deductible!

Choose the option below that best suits:

• I would have given it no stars, however, this was not an option.

• I have read more brilliant insight and vision in "Harold And The Purple Crayon".

• Somewhere, Leonardo DiCaprio is crying over the loss of the trees that were pulped to make the paper for this....most likely on the deck of his superyacht en route to his next undeserved Environmental Award.

• I would rather shave a badger's balls than be seen with this book in my hands.

• You can almost hear the chalkboard screeching cackles as one struggles from one page to the next....oh, wait, that's the audiobook version.

• Some side effects may include cankles, a fetish for Chairman Mao pantsuits, and Non-Contagious Bacterial Pneumonia.

• Available at Walgreen's and other fine retailers...

ByNew Moonon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book could have been written alright. I didn't completely agree with some of the tone. But, it is an election, so some propaganda is expected. The thing that sunk this book for me though (about 80% through it right now) is that too many "facts" are cherry picked. The data on crime, guns and economy stand out. To say that America has more gun violence when compared with other nations is not the descriptive data point to use. When comparing America to it's own history, you can easily see that gun violence has been decreasing since the early 1990's. But, this doesn't fit the narrative in the book of a gun violence epidemic. I give it a 1 star review. If that facts choose were different, I would have given this book 3 stars at most. I thought the tone was a little condescending, so wouldn't give it any higher then that.

1.0 out of 5 starsBest cure for insomnia. Good luck making it past two paragraphs.
ByD. Marionon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I was given this book as a gift. I'm not sure that I will still classify them as a friend much longer, but they knew that I was not sleeping well and assured me that I would be put fast asleep if I attempted to read it.

They were 100% correct. The reading was more difficult than a Philosophy book written in Latin for a PhD program.

I believe that the book has been misclassified as it should be under the fiction section.

The nicest thing I can say about it was that it cured my insomnia, but it is painful to read.

If you think that you will garner any sort of logical thought from the book, then do not by this. But if you need to put to sleep without chemicals, this is the book for you, but be prepared for a painful read.

Not believing in burning or throwing books away, I read this cover to cover and became more amused and concerned that so many fools will actually vote for her.

I borrowed this book and it's pure Clinton propaganda. If you didn't know her, or her history, or her problems with telling the truth you may enjoy this book. If you HAVEN'T been living under a rock all these years, it will anger you and you're going to hate it. Based on the dismal sales, it's safe to say most people know who she is and what she truly stands for.

Difficult to understand how pneumonia or allergies can cause the left eye to deviate inward. Never heard of this and no explanation is offered in the book. I imagine the answer is on someone's backup server located in a bathroom in Colorado. I did enjoy how on the cover her running mate worked the National Socialism authoritarian hint for our future into her socialism plans for our country as outlined in the book.

1.0 out of 5 starsYou Can TRUST Hillary!!!
ByMagaon September 14, 2016
Format: Paperback
I guess my first review - like Hillary's State emails, cell phones, and computers; Rose Law Firm billings; Michael Savage's radio program, et al - went missing, so let me write it again.

I am going to wait for all of the excitement to die down before I purchase this, since Hillary implored the audience to "Buy My Book If You Want to Know What I Will Do As President" at last night's debate. I'm wondering though, couldn't we just look at what she has done so far in her lifetime political career to get a pretty good idea?

I can't imagine how she was able to condense 25 plus years of dedication to her own self interest into a book that will convince America that the Clinton Foundation really does give 94 percent to its causes, not 5.7 percent; that she really had no intention of misleading the American public about her emails while Secretary of State; that the FBI and Justice Department really did do a no holds barred investigation into her State Department activities; and that she isn't suffering from a debilitating, neurological disorder that could cause her to literally "shut down/short circuit" at any moment, as she did at the 9/11 memorial.

I could go on and on, but well, you get the picture! If her mouth is moving......

The lies and corruption contained between the covers of this book make it only good for toilet paper.

1.0 out of 5 starsPoorly written, poorly arranged, and without a strong voice.
ByJohnboy69on September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book, like every other political campaign book, seeks to convince the reader of its importance. This would be an easier task with a more effective work. Weak voicing hampers the strength of the message, and the ideas aren't backed by facts but by more ideas.

One would expect a propaganda piece such as this to bring something new to the conversation, but this one instead relies on "truisms" without providing foundations. The author seems far more willing to expect the reader to accept statements made on such shaky ground - an issue that undermines the entire structure of the book.

Speaking of structure, one would expect a published work such as this to have one. This book does not - not intentionally, at least. It appears as if the author simply copied and pasted "talking points" rather than considering the framework necessary to hold it together.

At the end, the Stronger Together fails to support itself, and the entire house of cards comes tumbling down. Maybe in the hands of a more skilled writer, or at least from a mind more adept at logic and reason, this book could have found its footing.

2.0 out of 5 starsA Political Work of Fiction
ByGeoKeithon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
A politician's view of the future, if only you elect them. This is political fiction, which focuses its message to all supposed down-trodden political groups. Just be aware and read it as such. My main point of contention is the name of this piece of political wishfulness, "Stronger Together"... How might the United States of America be stronger together when this type of divisive writing is purported to be a blueprint to the future of our country? One cannot create a united future for half of the country's population by tearing down what the other half has achieved and created.

ByPchapon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
It's sad that although Amazon is very Liberal, I was hoping that unlike the Media, they would show the reviews as people write them. I have purchased many items from Amazon, but I may have to change my way of shopping. This book is a bomb, and what more can you expect from a liar, a divider like Obama, and her running mate for vice president Tim Kaine calls himself a Catholic, but does not follow the Church's teachings, so if your not true to your religion, then you most certainly will not be true to the people, just like Hillary. They have both sacrificed their soul for a political position.

Of course the worlds delite ruleless classless creatures would be stronger together when they promote the true divides within society. It is they that created this anti-civilization we have lived in since the fall of Babylon. Folks, They are the great unwashed and You are the Elite on the street. Why?..because You have a conscience, can create and produce Value and they can only usurp and destroy your efforts. It all boils down to "Conscience"...Those that have and those that have not...it's the only true division in society.
This is our fight. "The Fight for Conscious Human Life"©, (available right here on Amazon)...let them not confound our language nor our history any longer, this is what progressives have done unto us because it was feared: "Nothing would be impossible unto us" and they, the ruleless delite would become irrelevant.

Stop doing business with your rulers and Start ruling yourself.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe Empress Has No Clothes
ByFlashon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
It is so encouraging that many Americans have seen the truth about Hillary Clinton. This book is just another obligatory candidate book (they ALL have them) and they are ALWAYS devoid of any worthwhile content (or anything new or substantial). They really are nothing more than campaign pamphlets (with more pages) and you have to be delusional to actually pay money for something like this. We know that this self-serving, corrupt and "would be" Empress Has No Clothes. The policies of the left are like poisonous spider venom and this book is just more of their same mind numbing and freedom killing solutions.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe book reads like a DNC talking points platform
Byworld civilization teacheron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
My liberal parents have been purchasing Clinton books for years as a way of indirect support for their belief in liberalism. Last week I saw that this book was purchased so reviewed each section. The book reads like a DNC talking points platform. Add to that their B.S. feel-good attitude where intentions are greater than outcome. That, to me, is the problem with Hillary's ideas and liberals in general. At some point reality needs to become the focus, not theoretical utopian ideas. Hillary's (and my parents) generation have really screwed up America. Then again, the DC elite crowd in general have screwed up America. Add to the fact that Hillary has paid so many people off she can get away with lying, cheating, murder and yet not be convicted convinces me that we are gone, in many ways as a nation.

Each sentence in this book has been carefully crafted together in a mind-bending collaboration of twisted truths and jaw-dropping manipulation of facts. Hillary Clinton does an amazing job of showcasing her natural-born talent to deceive. Kain, also adds a certain weasely side-kick element to this book of tales. The reason I'm only giving this book one star is because the cover had a small rip in it upon arrival.

1.0 out of 5 starsMore Deceit--this time from Hillary AND Amazon!
ByElise Nappion September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
I think it is absolutely frightening that Amazon deleted a significant number of reviews of this book that were critical, so as to make it appear that it is not as abysmal as it obviously is. Amazon has shown itself to be as duplicitous as the author herself. FYI, Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post which has--big surprise--endorsed Hillary Clinton.
I no longer have any faith in Amazon reviews, and the Big Brother behavior of Bezos/Amazon has inspired me to take my business elsewhere. If this kind of manipulation doesn't convince Amazon readers to vote for anyone other than Hillary Clinton, I don't know what will.

ByTonyon September 26, 2016

was able to read about 80% of this in a half hour at Barnes and Noble. Pure socialist garbage that gives no impression that the authors even understand basic economics. The book is in total denial about the economic destruction done in cities run by democrats for decades. It ignores our gaping trade deficits, probably because China and the Cartels bought the Clintons decades ago. This is a shallow, vapid, communist manifesto that masquerades as something new.

5.0 out of 5 starsShining Prose
ByChristopher Bunnon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book is an excellent follow-up to Rodham Clinton's previous book, "It Takes A Village." I am a big fan of these Marxist self-help books, particularly Farkus S. Smoochy's classic "My Neighbor's Cheese" and French theoretician Simone Boudoir's "Je Prends Votre Croissant Avec Beurre" (this translates to "I Grab Your Buttery Croissant", though Dr. Manolo Schwartzbaum's annotated version translates it as "I Squeeze Your Croissant Until the Butter Squirts Out").

Rodham Clinton's prose shines through in phrases such as "some wanted to stick with the king--some wanted to stick it to the king." This is pure poetry, post-modern to the point of meaning deconstruction, fraught with both classist commentary and neo-Hegelian dogmentarianism. More importantly, though, deliberate sentence-choice like this, as well as others like "hung in the balance," point to a barely repressed sexual rage, both beautiful, biting and blinding in Rodham Clinton's articulation of post-white western literary criticism.

While the Dublin School of feminist critique would interpret this as typical of post-Cretaceous gender diversification, it is important to balance the grammatical and rhetorical mastery of Rodham Clinton against the lesser needs of the bulk of planetary citizenry (both in contemporary racial and class coding, as well as the violence of inherent whiteness).

Similar to Aquinas' masterful (but not as nearly ground-breaking) work, "Summa Theologica," Rodham Clinton's book should be taken in single doses of a paragraph at a time, so compact, dense and delightfully inaccessible is her meaning, begging the necessity to be taken in minute pieces, not unlike how the wise consume the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion pepper (1.2-2 million Scoville units), lest digestion and emittance be impaired to the partaker's distress.

I was thoroughly disappointed in the read. I was expecting her to delve more into how to successfully run a "Pay for Play" scheme, how to collect Clinton Foundation donations from countries that wish to do us harm and how to totally ignore cries for help repeatedly from Ambassador Stevens while he was in Benghazi. Most importantly, there was no lesson on how cold hearted you must be to lie to the grieving families about a YouTube video. This book had none of that.
The only positive I can say is unlike Nancy Pelosi's famous quote...you don't have to buy it, to see what's in it!!!

I really liked this tome! It is amazing what ghost writers can do to help Presidential candidates hide their Parkinson's disease. Of course, Tim Kaine can try to make Hillary seem stronger as the Parkinson's stage 3 takes an increasing toll on her physical and mental abilities. Ghost writers can more books and fix Hillary Clintons name when she is barely able to drink a glass of without coughing and coming down with aspiration pneumonia. Eventually, Citizen will become President Kane. Hallelujah!

Jeff Bezos has ruined Amazon's reputation and he is trying to manipulate his customers politically much as his champion Hillary had manipulated the public for 30 years and hopes to double down on the next 8 years.

2.0 out of 5 starsA Must-Read! BUT Leave the Lights On
ByA. ReaderTOP 500 REVIEWERon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I recommend all Americans read this, but be warned...it is scary, so leave the lights on.

As expected, this book is nothing more than a sales pitch. You will see the pronoun “we” on every page, as Hillary attempts to bring us all along with the grandiose plans she lays out, neglecting to mention that “we” (as in the taxpayers) will be paying heavily for every item.

I understand this is a book written by a politician, and that it will project the policies of the author. I have attempted in this review not to debate what was written, but to allow the statements to stand on their own (and when I do offer a rebuttal, it is not my opinions but facts presented by other sources). It is sad that it is easy to find these sources, and many that normally do not sit in the conservative camp. For instance:

Hillary states lobbyists forced legislation leading to the 2015 surge in auto sales, while all the articles I researched credited cheap gas and low interest rates.

“The super-rich are skipping out on paying their fair share of taxes…” As reported by NBC, and others: The top 1% already pay almost half of the federal taxes.

Much of the book focuses on the “feel good” programs, which are backed up by flimsy evidence, if backed up at all. For instance:

College loans. Hillary says 25 million borrowers will be helped by refinancing, the typical borrower saving $2000 over the life of the loan (this is $16.50 a month over ten years, $5.50 a month over 30 years – no reason to uncork the champagne…and there is no mention of the cost of refinancing). Entrepreneurs would receive a three-year deferment on paying, and this largesse could be extended also to the employees. Of course, all borrowers could just hold out for twenty years and wait for the loans to be forgiven. No mention of where all this money to repay the banks would come from.

Lastly, we are confronted by the twists and turns of illogical thought, such as:

Businesses should not be concerned with their profits and need “…to break free from the tyranny of today’s earnings report so they can do what they do best: innovate, invest, and build tomorrow’s prosperity.” And I thought the idea was to make a profit so you could reinvest and grow the business, which in turn provides more and better-paying jobs (sorry, my one opinion/rebuttal).

One could write another book addressing everything in this one. While I hate to put unnecessary money in any politician’s pocket, I do encourage conservatives and liberals/progressives to read it in order to fully understand the Democratic candidate's agenda.

Why does she entrust her role to others?
Why does she resort to low-blows when she vows to "trumps hate"

Of course, we know that is not true because, as the President has stated, most of his economic programs did not provide the outcomes he planned. The book continues with lie after lie. Most of them the typical Democratic strategy of "straw man" arguments, creating examples that do not exist, a misrepresentation of the issue, or oversimplifying the discussion and then attacking that version.
If you love Hillary Clinton, you will love this puff piece of biographical fiction. If, however, you are an open-minded thinker and believe that truth is better than self-promotion, this book might not become your favorite.

1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon doctored the reviews for this book!!!
ByDVK888on September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
The book, co-authored by Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, sold just 2,912 copies in its first week on sale, according to Nielsen BookScan. And the online ratings have been abysmal, with 81 percent one-star ratings and an average of only 1.7 on Amazon.com after it hit book shelves on Sept 6.
Amazon, however, has tried to fix that. According to WND.com -- which has been tracking the number of reviews -- Amazon deleted hundreds of comments last week that were critical of the book, which lays out a policy blueprint of how the country would look under a Clinton-Kaine administration.
On Thursday, Amazon -- whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post -- said there were 91 positive reviews compared to 166 critical ones, according to WND. Just two days earlier, there were 1,244 reviews -- 81 percent of them with one-star and 16 percent with five-star ratings, the website reported.
As of Monday morning, 85 percent of the customer reviews on Amazon gave it one star, while only 11 percent gave it five stars.
The book dropped from No. 840 on Amazon's best-seller rankings early last week to No. 1,538 on Thursday.
One reader, identified as Robert S Lionel JR, gave the book a one-star rating and wrote, "Every time I write my review it gets deleted, it's so weird. Does anyone know where the servers are hosted that contain reviews?"
Another reader commented: "I expected that Amazon tweaked reviews but have lost all belief in Amazon reviews now. Will switch to Walmart for ordering most the things I used to buy here."
According to Amazon's description, the book "presents [their] agenda in full, relating stories from the American people and outlining the Clinton/Kaine campaign's plans on everything from apprenticeships to the Zika virus."
Many of the poor reviews appeared to hit the candidate rather than the substance of the book. Of the comments that critiqued the book, readers used words such as "boring" and "dishonest" in describing the 250-page text interspersed with bullet-point policy ideas.

It chronicles several flawed and highly suspicious accomplishments of the Democrats and fails to mention much of the Democrat racism such as the Wasserman/Brazile e-mails they had to resign over. We are stronger together but tolerance must be a 2-way street.

When Hillary and Whatsizname are ready to pay me to take the rest of the press run off their hands, I'll order 30 cubic meters.

After 30 years in office, you would expect more substance than just this blueprint. Lots of intriguing aspirational anecdotes that read more like a disjointed Utopian manifesto than a coherent, integrated, and acheivable strategy. Light on objective data, no word on how to achieve bipartisan support, or how to gain consensus while publicly repeating that more than half the country's electorate is "deplorable and irredeemable".

Her husband is at the center of 7 different sexual abuse claims and has settled at least 2 that I have heard of. Innocent people do not settle out of court for huge sums of money.

I actually borrowed this from a friend whose ex-girlfriend left it at his place, and he was going to toss it. I didn't read the entire thing, but a good portion of it. I'm not sure who actually wrote it for Clinton, but it's very scripted and tries very hard to cover up many of the allegations made against her. It was good for a chuckle, but I certainly wouldn't waste my own money on it.

ByJeffery W. Countrymanon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
The book is not very informative and very boring. You don't really read much the candidates themselves wrote... You could pretty much google their names and read articles to get the same info. Whomever put this book together for them did a very poor job. I was hoping to get at least some new information or insight instead of the same old rhetoric. Sad

Really not worth the paper its printed on. These ideas are purely to get her elected. She has never kept her word about much of anything. That said, the book is also a waste of time, not interesting and in many places not truthful either...

That context would tell me a lot because who the heck would hire the Grinch as a running mate unless they had some kind of severe brain damage. Look at that guy! He even looks dumber than bush jr.

How much did Hillary pay Amazon to erase all these book reviews? Wonder how long Amazon will keep my review up. Pathetic! No matter who your choice is, this kind of practice is sickening. It also shows what a scam the mega giants constantly put in front of the public's eyes so that they can control the sheep. I'm still wondering when this woman will be put in jail. I guess when you have high power friends that can erase anything bad, you are golden.

I was given this book to use as a bird cage liner & used just the first few pages of the introduction. After 20 minutes, I went to check on the birds & found that 2 are dead (1 from a mysterious car crash, although it lacks a car & there's no evidence of a crash) & the other from workplace violence (however, Mr. Cheepers never had a job!), 1 is flip-flopping around the bottom of the cage while his buddy is trying to jab him in the neck with some sort of needle & the other is cowered on the lower perch, staring into the void repeatedly saying "just power through it, just power through it." I'm afraid that there is something in the ink that is toxic,

Mr. Bezos,

I have been a long time Amazon customer and have spent thousands with your company as I felt you were on the level and provided a valuable service and products. My purchases run the gambit from clothing, car parts, gifts, books and even items I have purchased for the business I work at and the one I owned.

I have now found out that you are willing to lie to me, the guy with the money, to make sure your choice for the office of President of the united States gets a more favorable presentation of her book than what is reality.

Our relationship is now significantly different than it was 24 hours ago, starting with the item I had in my cart and my wish lists. They will be deleted.

ByDeadlawon September 26, 2016

It is not fair that reviewers are giving this book only one star. First, it has sequentially numbered pages and a cover that, being somewhat thicker than the pages, effectively repels dust and minor spills. The entire tome was the perfect size to place under the legs of my bed to raise the headboard end. That helped prevent the acid reflux that I suffered from trying to read it. Not many authors are that considerate.

There really is nothing "new" here in regards to her approach to resolving the countries issues. Just a bunch of old ideas that have not worked in the past and have a very small chance of making an impact in the future.

At the risk of being placed on some NSA and FBI list, I must record my general disgust and nausea for this woman. Another reviewer was correct, the Authors of the reviews are awesome and that's what is entertaining to read. BTW, why is Kaine giving the Nazi salute? Hmmmm. Let's help Shrillary get to the big house, perhaps Ft. Levenworth.

1.0 out of 5 starsNot what I expected
Byjsmit86on September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
OK, I can really only give this book 1 star. The content is about as I expected; typical Globalist/Socialist propaganda. That alone would have qualified for perhaps 2 stars, but I ran into a problem with this book as I went through security at the airport.
As I passed through security, buzzers started going off! WTH??? At first I had a couple of TSA types getting ready to frisk me, but fortunately I was instantly surrounded by some very friendly FBI agents. They said not to worry; it was just a little bit of uranium left over from Hillary’s deal with the Russians as part of her program to spread the wealth around. The FBI guys grabbed a cloth, (soaked in some sort of cleaner… bleach-bit I think), and wiped the book clean. Not a trace of any of that nasty stuff was left!

Unlike some other reviewers, I was not offered any Ambassadorship, or lucrative speaking engagements. Keep in mind that I only paid $9.59 for the book. I did however receive the offer for an Internship with Bill Clinton for my Daughter, or any other young females that I might be able to send his way. It seems a bit fishy. I know that he did not actually have sex with any of them, but I heard one former Intern quoted as saying that the relationship left a bad taste in her mouth. What do you guys think?

5.0 out of 5 starsI tried it the other way but clearly this is the way to succeed.
ByA. Rosaon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
It is amazing that a book that bears every resemblance to Mein Kampf. I find it surprising that this book would garner such support from the CEO of this fine web retailer. Let's set aside the fact that this review debacle has once and for all removed any credibility from the review process. Clearly reviews get manipulated to suit corporate goals. I just wrote this to see if any old five star review gets through where any negative review gets rejected. My original review never even got the common courtesy of a rejection notice. It simply disappeared like so many of H Clitons political detractors, a few bullets in the back, problem solved. This fantasy novel outlines a truly horrific outline for society. A model for failure in every sense. I did cancel my Prime membership renewal after seeing this prime example of media manipulation in progress. Every twisted finger does the bidding of the evil master. Who is to say who is behind this Soros, The Rothschilds?

1.0 out of 5 starsLaborious with No Voice; Likely Written by Interns
ByAéyesson September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
My review is of a free copy which was given to me to review. I wish the book had been a more enjoyable expose of Mrs. Clinton's plan for America. It was a slow laborious read which appears to have been written by interns on the staff. There is no consistent voice. I can't imagine that anyone who would enjoy this book doesn't already know everything that's in it. Anyone on the fence about Mrs. Clinton's policy ideas would be bogged down by an extreme amount of pointless data that would likely never make it into any law. The ideas are a rehash of every extreme liberal wishlist of the last 40 years all crammed into one policy book that would have been better served to have been free on her website. This book should be free for all; unfortunately it's shouldn't be read by any.

5.0 out of 5 starsA poorly written propaganda piece which took my innocence by force.
ByJay2theBeeon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book is so poorly written that it actually gave me nightmares. I kid you not.
I dreamed that Hillary, dressed as an English professor, proceeded to savagely and forcibly sodomize me with her wrinkly member one fateful morning due to my lack of punctuation skill; exactly the same way she will violently corn-hole the rest of the country if she wins the election.

Lord help me, I can still smell the arthritis cream. I can still taste her foul breath. I can still feel the cottony soft pant-suit slamming away against my battered body as I begged for mercy.
Mercy, which never came.

I gave this rather robust collection of toilet paper 5 stars, simply because that's the exact amount of stars I woke up seeing the next day. In the aforementioned dream, once I had recovered from the horrific rectal breach delivered by The Hill-dawg, I was eventually able to walk again. Sadly, once I fully regained the use of my legs, Hillary (voracious lover that she is) again turned her vile and perverse appetite upon my blackened & bruised nether-regions, causing me to lurch out of bed in pain and smack my head on the nightstand. Hence my seeing stars.

What a vivid dream.

1.0 out of 5 starsFriends and colleagues rave
ByDavid DeFehron September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback
"everything [she] touches she kind of screws up with hubris."
"The media isn't fooled and she is getting crucified."
"They are going to dick up the legitimate and necessary use of emails with friggin' record rules,"
“I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect. A 70-year-old person with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational, with a husband still dicking bimbos at home"
"Hillary has not been covering here [sic] self with glory," Powell writes. "For good reason she comes across as sleazy."

I picked this book up at Good-Will for 1.00(which was still too much, I'm glad the money went to a good cause not a crook). If you read this book you will see how she will ruin the country and cause job loss also she continue to lie about somethings(anyone surprised) and you can tell Kaine is just bad as her plus her kiss up.

I recommend you buy this book used for as cheap as you can just because it shows you how bad this woman is

What a waste of natural resources and energy. From how hard they work (Clinton/Kaine) to how the same ideas Obama had are suddenly going to work for them, this is proof positive just how out of touch Clinton really is. I got this from a Democrat friend and we're both wondering when are Democrats going to stop the power mongering and get back to actually helping the little guy.
Guess Amazon uses the same server as Clinton email!

Hillary and Kaine. They wear a nice smile, but hide their dark hearts. Both are fully corrupt, bought and owned. Look at Kaine's history as a Jesuit Liberation Theology sociopath in South America, and Hillary's war-torn record and ties to the megalithic fraud the Clinton Foundation.

This book is ghost-written propaganda and is as effervescent as the wispy flotsam touted as policy by these cronies.

1.0 out of 5 starsSocialist propagada and political manipulation by Amazon for the dumocrats. Disgusting on both parties part.
ByTheWaldoon September 24, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
I too have previously written a review of this book that was among those that were deleted by Amazon. Very poor of them and of BOZOhead to take issue with the folks who review this piece of trash and delete their (our) comments in order to FALSIFY the portrayal of this piece of garbage. This is not the Amazon I have been accustomed to and is smelling a bit like Facebook and zuckerhead with all his political BS manipulating as of late. And the fact that BOZO owns the Washington Post rag mag and has personally hired 20 reporters to do nothing but to try to dig up trash on Mr. Trump should tell us that our comments about this garbage book are likely to be trodden underfoot.

Yes, I have read part of this book and it is garbage. Nothing but communistic and socialistic propaganda for those who mindlessly drink the koolaid that still freely flows. This book does nothing but continue the promotion of all the same failed policies of the last 8 years that have literally destroyed the very fabric of America and replaced it with a mindless mass that sucks up to big government looking for the proverbial handout. Look out, the UN police will soon be knocking on our doors courtesy of Hillary and her policies. And her muslim sidekick is a joke as well. Save your money unless you need some toilet paper..........that is all this book is good for.

1.0 out of 5 starsReally? I wasted my money on this one for sure.
ByDavid M. Shraderon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I agree with another reader and their analysis.
There is nothing redeeming in this book whatsoever and I should have known that but out of curiosity decided to wast the money and a few hours of reading to confirm it for myself. I am baffled at the pure ignorance of our electorate that thinks that just because someone promises lots of benefits with no means of paying for it other than punishing those who have worked hard to become successful or meaningless "Feel Good" positions even though they completely contradict prior positions by Hillary in the past just for the sake of luring voters. As if all of that was not bad enough... The corruptness of this campaign just continues blatantly all around us. These Dems just cannot win without cheating. In case you have noticed, Amazon has actively cooperated with this Dem Conspiracy to win an election at all costs by violating the integrity of the reviews here on their site. Negative reviews keep miraculously disappearing in large numbers. I am disgusted at the fact that the company I trust with Thousands of dollars in annual purchases could be so easily duped into violating that trust over an obvious political bias. It raises into question the overall integrity of the entire review process at Amazon that so many of us loyal customers have come to trust and depend on to make our buying decisions. I have been a ridiculously loyal amazon customer for many years now and make most of my purchases here out or both trust and convenience. At this point I am so frustrated, I will be looking hard at other providers who haven't proven to me their lack of integrity. Political Bias has no place anywhere, especially with an online retailer. I did not take the Walmart/Jet merger very seriously before, but now I think Amazon may be giving them their best opportunity to take market share away. Plenty of people are fed up with this mess.

ByAmazon Customeron September 18, 2016
Format: Paperback
A Saudi businessman paid me to buy the book. He offered me many dollars to buy the book claiming that it's for the good of his country. He said I have to buy the book because Hillary will let his country continue to fund terrorism and chop more heads off. After looking at the cover of the book, I had a bad case of diarrhea. With no toilet paper left, the book was a lifesaver. After my dumping, i decided to have a BBQ, but didn't have any lighter fluid. I ripped some pages out the book, and it worked wonders. After I finished eating, the food ran straight through me. Again, I had to use the book. I decided to finally sit down and read the book. I open the book and realized that I only had a few pages left. I accidentally used all the pages already, but at this time, what does it matter? I felt like the book deserved better treatment, so I got my secretary to smash the rest of the book with a hammer. The book was already crooked when I got it. Too bad I didn't buy the digital copy because I could have deleted it off my private server. I was also told that the book has been translated into Arabic to be sold in Benghazi for all you Arabic readers out there. P.S. I am writing this review on my personal computer because everyone does it

I read this book and found it poorly written, sophomoric and written at a level that would embarrass most fifth graders. What a waste of my time to read this book when I was expecting to get some actual, precise policy statements/positions the candidate was putting forth to improve America.

1.0 out of 5 starsMost dangerous person in history
ByP. R. B.on September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Hillary is the single most dangerous person to ever run for public office. She is completely owned by global elites, and is pushing their agenda which basically amounts to an NWO. If she wins this election, life as we know it will be over. No more free speech, no more right to bear arms, and finally the wholesale destruction of our nation through her "dream" of open borders. This is real life people, not a game.

Borrowed it from a friend and glad I didn't waste my money and the only reason it got 1 star was I couldn't get any lower. From what I got out of it, if elected, Hillary is going to make us the Democratic People's Republic of America. In other words, finish the US off by making us a Communist country.

And Amazon, I'm pretty sure you people will delete this. I'm about done doing business with yall if your honesty is no better than a Clinton's because you're obviously as untrustworthy as them.

1.0 out of 5 starsIn defense of amazon (sort of)
Byseaohon September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback
I will preface my review by saying I would never EVER ! vote for this lying criminal sack of weasel crap (no offence to weasels)

Having said that, For those 1 star reviewers whose reviews had been deleted to complain about Amazon rigging the reviewing system is a bit hypocritical. The vast majority of those reviewers were written by never Hillary people (like myself) who would not waste a penny on this propaganda BS. They are guilty of rigging the review system as much if not more than Amazon.

Having said that here is my one star review I won't bitch if amazon deletes it

The cover of this book looks so much like an ad for cialis l almost expected to see a disclaimer on the bottom of the page that read

"seek immediate medical attention for erections lasting more than 4 hours"

which is ironic because the contents of this book will leave you mentally and intellectually flat and limp.

1.0 out of 5 starsFantastic Fairy Tales to Share With Kids!
ByBilly Rubinon September 18, 2016
Format: Paperback
More stories about Hilary being an award winning cage fighter, master of nineteen languages and how George Lucas used her as a model for the Jedi knights. I truly enjoyed her story of how she translated racial epithets into the native language of the orphans that arrived from Syria thanks to her "delayed success" (not "failure") there. She also admitted she invented surfing, wrote songs with Mick Jagger and Tupac, saved a village in Arkansas from destruction from a herd of cows, and once broke her leg in nine places in a helicopter crash but ran for help and set a new record for women's track while doing so. She also claimed her perspiration smells like vanilla, personally assembled Steven Hawking's wheel chair, and won second place in the USMC because she was a woman.

It's odd though. I bought one copy but was charged 7 times for the one book.

1.0 out of 5 starsIf only Amazon would allow less than 1 star for reviews! This book deserves less
ByPowderskier12on September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
My review is not biased by my political leanings as I don't care for either candidate. I also must admit I didn't purchase the copy I read as I couldn't stomach the thought of any of my hard earned $ going to Clinton or Kane. One might expect the content to be self-serving , and it is. But, ,, this is such a poorly written and I might add, poorly edited book that it was painful to read. I only wish there was a category for less than 1 star. Hey, banks are considering offering negative interest rates, why not negative review numbers. If ever there were a book that deserves less than 1 review, this is it. To be fair, I have not read " The Art of The Deal " yet. That's next on my list. It appears that " Stronger Together " was written in a matter of days, or more likely, had a ghost writer pen some thoughts with the hope of making a quick buck. I can't honestly believe Clinton would stand to benefit any way than monetarily.

1.0 out of 5 starsSwan Song......
ByAmazon Customeron December 4, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Same old song from the same old crooners. Hilary Clinton is the consummate example of amorality in the pursuit of power. In this she is at least equal to her impeached husband and may have ascended to a mastery of the game of back door politics that Bill can only envy. As for Tim Kaine, from nothing he came, to nothing he has returned. Perhaps now the Clintons can finally be relegated to the scrap heap of history where they belong. But do not weep for the Clinton's fair liberals, whatever was left over of the $700,000,000.00 she raised for her campaign is hers to keep. I'm sure she managed to save the odd ten million here and the odd twenty million there against the unimaginable contingency that she lost the election. The Clinton candidacy left the Democratic party in ruins. The populist revolt of 2016 that brought political outsider Donald Trump into the White House should also be a wake up call for all of the entrenched members of the Republican machine devoted to special interests and politics as usual. It is a new day. Get with the program or get out. Americans want government of the people, by the people and for the people. Does that sound vaguely familiar Washington?

Also nothing about why she then hired the disgraced Debbie Wasserman Schultz who stepped down after this latest scandal. You would think that would be the stuff to get out to sell the book. Its a glossed over sugar coated pamphlet bulked up to fill a book.

1.0 out of 5 starsSame old diatribe, boring, Chasirman Maoish, and Stalinistic in thinking
ByC.Chuon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I found this book to be self absorbed! Absorbed in the Clintonesque view of what America should be rather than what America should be with a Constitution and maintaining it that way. I don't want America changed to the Clinton America. For all of it's faults America is perfect for me the way it is. We have a great country as it is, and I don't want it remade into a harlot for money. I don't see anything new in this book only the same old diatribe by an elitist self proclaimed person of the people who maintains herself above the law much as Chairman Mao and Stalin did. After reading this it just cements what people have been saying and it has changed me to the point I won't be voting for her, for the first time in my life I am voting for a Republican candidate.

Byrcmjoneson September 25, 2016

This is probably one of Hillary's best written works. it outlines her plans for making America "Stronger Together". Hillary and Kaine are obviously the better choice for the leadership of our country. I will be proud to vote for her in November. If you want to really understand the problems this country faces and real working solutions, then read this book! (And then do the opposite!) Everything said in the beginning of this review is the opposite of how i actually feel. My honest one star posting was deleted, so I'm trying again with 4 stars. I am so offended that Amazon is manipulating the reviews. For this reason I will refrain from making any purchases from Amazon in the foreseeable future. There are always alternatives.

1.0 out of 5 starsBIAS ALERT! Please don't hide my review Amazon!!
ByCarilynon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Really Amazon, YOU too!? I will now shop elsewhere.
BIAS ALERT: "Hillary Clinton's newest book, "Stronger Together," has been met with critical reviews and slow sales since its release earlier this month.
But Amazon.com appears to be helping the Democratic presidential nominee by removing negative reviews from its website, WND.com reported.
The book, co-authored by Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, sold just 2,912 copies in its first week on sale, according to Nielsen BookScan. And the online ratings have been abysmal, with 81 percent one-star ratings and an average of only 1.7 on Amazon.com after it hit book shelves on Sept 6.
Amazon, however, has tried to fix that.
According to WND.com -- which has been tracking the number of reviews -- Amazon deleted hundreds of comments last week that were critical of the book, which lays out a policy blueprint of how the country would look under a Clinton-Kaine administration.
On Thursday, Amazon -- whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post -- said there were 91 positive reviews compared to 166 critical ones, according to WND. Just two days earlier, there were 1,244 reviews -- 81 percent of them with one-star and 16 percent with five-star ratings, the website reported.
As of Monday morning, 85 percent of the customer reviews on Amazon gave it one star, while only 11 percent gave it five stars.
The book dropped from No. 840 on Amazon's best-seller rankings early last week to No. 1,538 on Thursday.
One reader, identified as Robert S Lionel JR, gave the book a one-star rating and wrote, "Every time I write my review it gets deleted, it's so weird. Does anyone know where the servers are hosted that contain reviews?"
Another reader commented: "I expected that Amazon tweaked reviews but have lost all belief in Amazon reviews now. Will switch to Walmart for ordering most the things I used to buy here."
According to Amazon's description, the book "presents [their] agenda in full, relating stories from the American people and outlining the Clinton/Kaine campaign's plans on everything from apprenticeships to the Zika virus."
Many of the poor reviews appeared to hit the candidate rather than the substance of the book. Of the comments that critiqued the book, readers used words such as "boring" and "dishonest" in describing the 250-page text interspersed with bullet-point policy ideas."

ByEconomist Loveron September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Tried to get through this book. Too close to lunch to stomach anymore of it. Thought it might guide me one way or the other, and it did. She is worse than Nixon. Corruption, subverting the constitution and a pathological liar. Her first instinct is to lie. Destruction of evidence. Where does it end ? Don't waste your money on this !

5.0 out of 5 starsJust like Hillary and the rest of them
ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Everyone is wrong. Bozo isn't doing this for political reasons. He is doing it for monetary reasons. Just like Hillary and the rest of them. We the people need to refuse to do business with these people. That's the only message they understand. HIllary has already lost the vote. The elite can't even keep up with removing the reviews of the people anymore. Have you noticed that Facebook and even the liberal papers comments are a good 80% anti Hillary? The polls are rigged. Fox News is even secretly pushing for Hillary with there hidden attacks on trump constantly. I say if they try to tell us that Hillary won the election we fill the streets and ask the Hillary supports to come do the same. We will quickly see that there was no support for Hillary. Colin Powell referred to us as the 99% in his leaked emails when describing what we would believe. If Powell was really a military man he would know that 99% against 1% is pretty poor odds for the 1%. We hold ALL the power at any moment we decide to use it... The power is money... Our money... Don't give it to anyone that try's to oppress us. Boycot them all. We could turn this country around in 2 weeks if we all just sat at home and didn't go to work. The elite would drop to their knees begging for mercy. The rich becomes the beggar and the fool becomes the wise. It's happening. Don't be scared...

1.0 out of 5 starsAbysmal Read!
ByWayneon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
What a horrible book. I attempted to read it, but was unable to stomach the Liberal Agenda. While the title sounds wonderful, I have seen an interesting video that showed the ability to snap a bung of green twigs when they were bundles together, but the single twig would bend and not break. In an agenda that promotes an entitlement society, we weaken the fabric of our society. Imagine an old sheet that has been washed many times and bleach has been used on it. It has many threads sewn together, yet it rips apart easily. OUR SOCIETY IS ONLY AS STRONG AS THE FABRIC THAT HOLDS IT TOGETHER. The fabric of our society needs to be based on honesty and integrity. The writer of this blueprint does not appear to have either. When she went through the scandal of Bill's, while he was in the Whitehouse and obviously a few of his interns, I held her with a high regard for appearing to stand by his side and bear the humiliation without turning on him. I failed to see at that time, it was just because her aspirations were to ride to the top and she didn't care what she had to do to get there. Now I am saddened to learn that Amazon is choosing to delete the reviews that are being posted on this book. I did not purchase it through Amazon, so they can not verify I purchased it. I borrowed a friends copy at work, just because I have always been told, Know your enemy! Now I intend to watch and see if they delete my review.

1.0 out of 5 starsAgenda of an incompetent politican
ByUSA Martial Artiston September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book like all of her books are well written. However, the book is clearly a campaign pitch and her trying convince you of something she is not and an agenda that she probably wont follow up in a competent manner if given the chance.. The book could be viewed by many readers as just another way for her to increase her bank account, a well documented c haracter trait. The book might serve a useful purpose to contrast this with her public statements, public service (if a realistic, unbiased account can be found). Public records and her own public statements clearly demonstrate a lack of credibility and a serious problem with the truth, certainly this is not a quality one would want in a book author. For those readers who truly want to read accurate, factual material Clinton's books fail on all accounts. With these comments in mind a buyer needs to reflect o n whether it is worth purchasing. It is assumed that readers (irregardless of political affiliation) will search to find the real truth that the Clinton's are hiding especially in their published materials. Clinton's lack of honesty clearly mars her as a believable author.

ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I borrowed this book from one of my friends who just adores Hillary. I found the book to be boring as heck. It is a rambling treatise of stories trying to relate on how Hillary will make America Great Again. Unfortunately, she is more boring in book form than in real life. I know more corpses that are more entertaining than her. It is really a horrible book. The only person that will be stronger about is Hillary as apparently she got like 14 million up front to make this book. I feel bad for them. The lady needs to get a real physical from a neurologist because many of the words were incomprehensible to me. Horrible book, Horrible book.

1.0 out of 5 starsHandy primer on grooming. A stunning minus 5 stars
Byword addictedon September 20, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
There is much about this book to discuss. I particularly liked the chapter on fashion, which plunges “garage-sale-chic” to a new low level. Most people inspired by unsightly hospital gowns, worn-out sofas, 1970’s drapes, quilted oven mitts, and burlap sacks would just recycle from those exact items and save a bundle on wardrobe costs. Hillary, however, has no need for frugality with all the donations she receives from shady foreign sources. Therefore, she found a way to successfully recreate every one of these signature looks AND spend thousands of dollars doing it! Much the way she would run a government program. Why spend less when you can spend more to achieve a disastrous result? (Still, I suspect in some lonely budget hotel on a bleak stretch of highway, a tired stained mattress is missing its bedspread.)
The chapter devoted to make-up offers helpful tips for any morally-diseased person whose decaying ethical condition has begun to manifest physically. Efforts to disguise this inconvenient problem finally culminated in the combined use of mortuary cosmetics, copious drugs, and various medical devices (cleverly hidden under the aforementioned garments), along with snarky misdirection and outright lies to deflect the truth. The ultimate result is the candidate you now see shuffling unsteadily up to a podium to cough disingenuous, divisive rhetoric into a microphone before tepid crowds of dozens. Here we find the real drama of the story. Will all the tape, spackle, boosters, supports, and trickery hold? Or will we witness another devastating public collapse? We shall see.
The chapter on personal hygiene: Short. Woefully short. Shampoo wasn’t even mentioned.
This book teaches what a gargantuan effort it is to prop up a crumbling failed ideology and maintain an illusory, deceitful public image. Even with the help of a fawning and complicit media, it’s not an easy task to deceive the populace. There just isn’t much time left over for accomplishing anything productive, fulfilling promises, running a clean campaign, or rescuing a dying friend under siege in remote Benghazi.
Unfortunately, I have to give this book minus 5 stars due to the stale plot, which is nothing more than a thinly-disguised plan to transfer individual sovereignty and resources to the political elite. But I like to end on a high note: though poorly written and deservedly criticized, this book will go on to grace many a bargain bin in dollar stores across this land and eventually find its way into the sewers and landfills of our great nation. Where it will be right at home.

The book is terrible but what the writers intend to do to our country is HORRIBLE ! I suggest everyone read the book if for no other reason to help decide who they should vote for.

1.0 out of 5 starsPure Fiction

The book was well written but should have been listed as fiction. What she outlines that she can do has to be pure fiction or they would've been done in the last eight years.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe Washington Post called this " a deplorable campaign book." and they weren't lying.
ByAquabachon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
The Washington Post reviewed it best:
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have written a deplorable campaign book.
As Carlos Lozada said in his professional review "
I don’t understand why this book was compiled — “written” is too generous a verb — or why it was published. If you really want to dive into the Clinton/Kaine promises and proposals, the campaign website awaits you. You don’t need to wade through this book. No one does. No one should. The only people I imagine reading it are future fact-checkers, masochistic book critics and the most strung out of political junkies."

It's a joke. I was given this book as a joke because I despise Hillary. And it lived up to it.
I tried to read some of it. What a piece of garbage.
Filled with campaign rhetoric and nonsense.
Just like Hillary I guess. But at this point as Hillary said after she let 4 Americans die in Benghazi " What difference does it make?"
The entitled eat this class warfare lunacy up.

Trump may be a loudmouth, but he does not need our money and only wants to make us strong again. This tired old hag will be our undoing. Benghazi should make her ineligible for public office for the remainder of her sad life.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe Title is Mileading
ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
For one, the Title itself is misleading. We have had many decades of Hillary Clinton. The Stronger Together motto gives the illusion that we would part of the solutions she outlines in her very boring book. Her solutions won't work and are filled with the continual lies she is so famous for. No one trusts her and "the people" would NEVER have a voice in. This is a runaway train. Just another lie along with the other trash in her book. It was nice fiction though.

1.0 out of 5 starsInspiring! Fulfilling! A God-Send!
ByDeson September 15, 2016
Format: Paperback
Reading this book is a religeous experience. You find yourself feeling the beat of your heart leap from your chest in ferver. No exaggeration, my hand flies autonomously into the air after every paragraph as I exhail that familliar mantra. As I imagine a world where everyone is equal, I am proud to know that achieving that by any means necessary is moral.

Hillary provides serveral exames of a new world worth fighting for. Where the master race has full control. I am unsure if when she says 'Muslim' she means White or not, but that is a defail for a later date. As she is white herself

In all, I included an excerpt from the book in the images. Please read it and if you feel inspired, this is a Must Buy for you!

May our Dear Leader win, regardless of how,

Pepi.

BySelestino Zamoraon September 24, 2016

Jeff Bozo, you and Amazon, as great as it is, are going to go down the tube like Hillary if you don't stop deleting all of the negative Hillary book reviews. You are going to lose many good customers so wise up buddy. In the book, I was looking to see how Hillary and Bill were able to delete all of those witnesses that never got to testify against them, and got away with it, since Bill was governor of Arkansas. But no such luck. I also wanted to learn more about the illegal drugs for guns that were flown in to Mena airport by the CIA in Arkansas when Bill was governor, but again no such luck. You cannot make this stuff up. Stranger than fiction. And I do not read fiction.

1.0 out of 5 starsThis Book Is A Blueprint for A NeoLib Wet Dream
ByDarrell Critzon September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback
Save yourself the nightmares and do not read this dark, horrible book. It details how Clinton and Kaine can become stronger together by raking in unending cash from Wall Street, foreign governments, various lobbyist groups and by renting out the Lincoln bedroom. Hillary's ghost writer chillingly informs the reader how HRC and Timmy plan to usher in a renewed age of corporate bailouts, global outsourcing, marginalization of minorities, environmental fracking and continual wars for profit. This haunting tome will serve as the NeoLiberal guide for fear mongering, rigging elections and manipulating the gullible for years to come. Please save both your money and your sanity and avoid reading this blueprint for corruption, selfishness and greed.

2.0 out of 5 starsStimulates my Bowels!
ByBig Daveon September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
As bad as this book was, it does have a huge therapeutic effect. I suffer from chronic constipation. I found that reading this book gives me a violent urge to purge my bowels! The pages do make for poor toilet paper, however. I recommend just keeping the book intact for its purging effect. Best read when actually seated on a toilet!
Weight gain readers can possibly benefit from the books potential emetic qualities. Violent urges to orally purge one's stomach contents can be had from any reading of this book.
Sorry. I tried to be clinical (look up the word "emetic") rather than graphic. But the book does have beneficial qualities that have been largely over looked. Two whole stars!

1.0 out of 5 starsJeff Bezos supports Hillary because he benefits from terrorism
ByJ. Y.on September 22, 2016
Format: Paperback
30 years records of personal gain but public failure. This is the type of person we need least for this country. This book is not worth reading.

Jeff Bezos supports Hillary because he benefits from terrorism. With terror attacks to the malls, people avoid to go to shores and instead do shopping on Amazon. Amazon sales surge as a result. That's why Jeff Bezos supports Hillary's open border policy and welcomes more refugees with ISIS fighters infiltrated. And that's exactly why Amazon deletes thousands of one star reviews of Hillary's book.

1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon erased my previous review, so now I will review Amazon
Bytim stoneon September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback
Shame on you Amazon for deleting truthful reviews. Befoer you delete a review that states the book sucks, perhaps you should read it. Then you will know it sucks. The book is horrible. Exactly what you would expect from horrible candidates. Gary Johnson's book " Don't ask me questions" would be a better use of the money. Hillary failed on the book. Amazon failed on the cover up.

ByC. C. Normanon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Clinton and Kaine don't have a plan for America that will work. They want to continue with the same ineffective and corrupt policies of the failed Obama regime. Clinton is a filthy liar who has compromised the security of the nation and is responsible for the deaths of four brave Americans in Benghazi during the terrorist attack on 11 Sept 2012. Don't buy books from crooks.

It's beyond sad when retailers alter the input from its members. It's dangerous to the Republic when they take sides. She is not fit and the book is a feeble attempt to address that problem. Mostly it is about her greed and the willingness of publishers to cater to her. They knew this book was a loser yet still gave her money. Hmmmmmm, I wonder why they would throw money away???? Because they expect something back for their investment.

I do have to wonder about those reviews that are 'verified buyers'. The Clinton Foundation has lots of friends and capital to buy the books and write fake reviews.

I seem to remember the Scientologists used to buy bunches of L Ron's book just to keep it up on the Best Seller's list.

Also note that Jeff B's guys now seem to not remove the reviews since everyone is now watching.

ByIzabela Bartnickaon November 2, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book would be a good sleeping aid if it did not have Mrs Clintons picture on the cover. Looking at the photo gave me nightmares. I often wake up in a cold sweat hearing a shrill voice and laughter in my head. I wish I could un-sea her face and never have to look at it again but honestly what difference at this point does it make?

It must be those damned Russian hackers that keep erasing my negative reviews of this book. It certainly couldn't be Amazon that erased my and the hundreds of other negative reviews of the worst piece of political pooh-poor I think I've ever tried to read. Or maybe it was aliens or one of those Independent voters? What other possible reason could there be for these mass deletions??? Since anyone who says bad things about the Clintons disappears, if I don't make it through the night, save yourself and the money you would have spent on this pile of papers that really is embarrassing to classify as a book!

1.0 out of 5 starsSocialism as expected...
ByTactical Joeon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Following the same sentiments of her last book, " It Takes a Village", basically Hillary outlined her plan to socialize America. If she had well-thought out responses to the questions plaguing America, it might have made this at least an informative read. However, her knee-jerk reactions to issues such as race relations, and gun violence are all too tired. What we need is someone in office who recognizes that the system is broken, and is not afraid to hold accountable those in charge.

Amazon had some bad press when it came to deleting reviews on 'ol hills book. Took 'em a while to figure out how to protect her in a round-about way by stating: "reviews by verified purchases first". Now I see they're doing the same on chelsea's book; filled with teddy bears and bs and nothing about how parents should protect their children from pervs like her father.

I wish I would have waited to buy this book after she lost the election, it's now cheaper than toilet paper!

1.0 out of 5 stars[Review Keeps Getting Deleted - Yet Was Reconstructed From My Own Private eMail Server]
ByNeuroSpliceron October 4, 2016
Format: Paperback
It is customary for presidential candidates to have a book ghostwritten for them and released months before the election. After all, the more exposure a candidate gets (and the more shady donations one can launder as a "book deal"), the better, right?
Well, not if one has so many itchy things to hide and, by simply ignoring them, said book only drives the desire to scratch them even deeper.

Let me make something very clear at this point: I am no fan of the orange, hair-plugged, narcissistic con-artist that runs against her. Nevertheless, even if one were to use this book as the only source of information, crooked-Hillary is not any better choice either.

INFLATED NON-SPEAK & NEBULOUS PROMISES
The book can serve as a case study for political non-speak: how to utter words aiming to stir emotions yet manage to say absolutely nothing in the process. For instance, take the phrase "breaking down the barriers that hold Americans back": who exactly is holding Americans back and how did they manage to get away with it for so long? Is it Islam? The... French? Is the Canadians again, with their polite apologies!?
No. It is the stagnated economy (the direct result of Hillary's husband deregulating the Banking sector, giving them a card-blanche to run amok with his 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act) and special interests lobbyists who siphon away jobs to slave-labor countries and then get tax exemptions for "creating jobs" in the trickle-down delusion.
Does Hillary address any of these issues in the book? Don't be silly, of course not. She has slogans to repeat.

WHO IS EXACTLY THE "Together" REFERRING TO?
She cannot possibly mean Americans: Hillary called more than half of them "idiots" and "irredeemable".
She cannot possibly mean women: Hillary has harassed, shamed and gagged all of her husband's rape victims. And if you think that number is small, you are not paying close enough attention.
And she cannot possibly mean the world: Hillary views people as inanimate stepping stones for her ambitions and the profits of her handlers. They can be assassinated, bombed, suicided (sic) or droned (now live) while she breaks in her trademark sociopath laughter.
So, it must be the Bankers she has been serving all of her life, and now wants to be their willing pre-bought mouthpiece.
(Puppet sold as shown. Some assembly required. Batteries in hidden device not included. Warranty does not cover brain damaging "pneumonia").

WHO IS SHE PROMISING TO MAKE "Stronger" EXACTLY?
American people have been scared of the word "socialist". Quite understandably, since socialism means higher taxes (in order to support the required social infrastructure and support programs) - and who could possibly trust Washington pork-barrons with even more taxes? Trillions go missing as it is. However, American has been locked into a perpetual war for 60 years now, (WWII, Korea, South-East Asia, Vietnam, Cold War, Middle East) and taxpayers' money get blown away for nothing: the average American has seen no real benefits from all these expansive wars but empty words, flags waved (and folded) and faded bumper stickers
Does Hillary promise in the book she put her name on to dismantle the perpetual war machine and instead relocate the country's resources in settling the ongoing class-war the poor are obviously losing? Is she promising to make the average American stronger? No. She is simply foreshadowing her intentions to commit even further, in an all-out war with anyone that would dare doubt she dangles two huge ones. In other words: gather provisions and get your shelters ready, she is itching to nuke Vladimir only to prove she is tough.
Now, who exactly is this going to make stronger? The Military-Industrial Complex of course, silly!

DID Amazon SIDE WITH THE CORPORATE MEDIA AGENDA?
There are numerous indicators but when even vapid Sarah Palin book outsells you by 300%(!), Hillary's party must know by now how lame their horse is in this race. The sensible thing to do would be to change candidate while there is still plenty of time and go with someone more palatable and less things to hide. I am sure there are plenty of good women and men that could run much more successful against an overinflated orange balloon. What they do instead: they mobilize all their corporate media in order to employ saturation propaganda and skew the electoral result. At this point it is to be expected from Hollywood and corporate media to side with their puppet - but Amazon too?

Shame.

ByKim in Minnon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I expected that Amazon tweaked reviews but have lost all belief in Amazon reviews now. Will switch to Walmart for ordering most the things I used to buy here. Netflix and Hulu work just fine in place of Amazon's prime tv / movie service. Etsy is better than Amazon for craft supplies.

The ideas in this book are detrimental for our country. Their plans call for more taxation and regulation particularly for businesses. No new ideas just the same ideas. The government knows what is best for you.

ByChris Gregoryon October 14, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
Ghostwritten to pump up the campaign. Much of this book is deception. There is no mention of Hillary's destruction of 33,000 subpoenaed emails or the dozen cell phones, no mention of the Benghazi lies, and certainly nothing about Hillary's attacks of her husband's accusers. It's hard to believe that 40% of polled citizens could be so gullible to believe her deceptions or that they'd be so naive to overlook her illegalities just to have a female president.

Should be entitled MORE DECEPTIVE TOGETHER!

1.0 out of 5 starsCant review something I refused to read, so I reviewed the table of contents
ByThreeJDaddyon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Stay true to the values that have always made America great

Women’s rights

Open Internet

LGBT rights

HIV/AIDS

Development

Ending modern-day slavery

This excerpt is from the free Amazon preview...As you might assume, yes, I made it all the way through the table of contents with my stomach still in tact. That is until I saw this gem. I don't remember our Founding Fathers (the ones who actually made America great) arguing over LBGT rights, womens rights, HIV/AIDS blah blah blah in order to make this country great. Yes we all agree that slavery is bad and is not an acceptable practice. We decided that almost 200 years ago (sorry south, Abe was right). Protecting a liberal minority group's rights by limiting the constitutional right's of the conservative majority will not make this country great. Redistribution of wealth (lets call it what it is) will not make America great. Only when we as a country get back to the moral and ethical foundation on which we were established can we become great once again.

Book is slow and quite boring. I was able to read through it in a few hours and this comes off as a manifesto for Clinton and her shaded view of the world as she sees it and wants to mold it into. If I wanted a bullet paper of her so-called enlightened vision, I would have contacted her campaign folks for a policy bullet paper. Do not waste your time buying it, just listen to her speeches and you get the mantra from her and Tim Kaine (her surrogate).

Thank you for this book. I think what the title refers to is the fact that Tim Kaine is so scary that standing together on the cover with him actually makes Hillary look stronger. It's had the effect of making me hope that Hillary is in better health than she appears to be, so I give it 3 stars for that. I recommend that she publish another book called "How To Turn $1000 Into $100,000 In The Cattle Futures Market" with her and Donald Trump on the cover.

1.0 out of 5 starsDisappointed
ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
I began reading this book with an open mind as I truly wanted to learn more of Hillary's and Tim's policy plans for making their 'Stronger Together' claim. Unfortunately the book lacks any form of details and doesn't get past one liner, lofty statements. This book is weak at best and not worth the money or time spent reading it.

1.0 out of 5 starsI tried
ByCindy McMackinon September 26, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition
I was hoping to get an insight into the woman. It was basically a long brochure.I think it could speak to someone who already likes her a lot. But it did not help me - a person looking to try and understand her. It just had none of the warmth I wanted and did not help me to trust her thoughts or actions. Sorry, guys. Tried.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe corruptness of this campaign just continues blatantly all around us
ByJDBon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
There is nothing redeeming in this book whatsoever and I should have known that but out of curiosity decided to wast the money and a few hours of reading to confirm it for myself. I am baffled at the pure ignorance of our electorate that thinks that just because someone promises lots of benefits with no means of paying for it other than punishing those who have worked hard to become successful or meaningless "Feel Good" positions even though they completely contradict prior positions by Hillary in the past just for the sake of luring voters. As if all of that was not bad enough... The corruptness of this campaign just continues blatantly all around us. These Dems just cannot win without cheating. In case you have noticed, Amazon has actively cooperated with this Dem Conspiracy to win an election at all costs by violating the integrity of the reviews here on their site. Negative reviews keep miraculously disappearing in large numbers. I am disgusted at the fact that the company I trust with Thousands of dollars in annual purchases could be so easily duped into violating that trust over an obvious political bias. It raises into question the overall integrity of the entire review process at Amazon that so many of us loyal customers have come to trust and depend on to make our buying decisions. I have been a ridiculously loyal amazon customer for many years now and make most of my purchases here out or both trust and convenience. At this point I am so frustrated, I will be looking hard at other providers who haven't proven to me their lack of integrity. Political Bias has no place anywhere, especially with an online retailer. I did not take the Walmart/Jet merger very seriously before, but now I think Amazon may be giving them their best opportunity to take market share away. Plenty of people are fed up with this mess.

1.0 out of 5 starsPianfully lacking long winded read about nothing new but Democratic fairy tales written to garner votes from uneducated voters!
ByMark A.on October 24, 2016
Format: Paperback
I grew up in a Democratic household. I hold Social Democratic views. I do not
believe that the Democratic party is the party for the middle class. They have
lied to us for decades. Just look at the toll that has been paid by poorly educated
Democratic cities around the country. I thought the book was bland, manipulative
and lacking in any substantive content, just like their speeches.

Where have all the good Democrats gone?

1.0 out of 5 starsThey claim to be pro-choice
BySgt. Rockon October 21, 2016
Format: Paperback
but force all to comply with their un American agenda.

I looked through this book and came away with thought that these two clowns would cause even more damage than the prior two, Obozo and Biden.

A comparison between Biden and Kaine shows that the number 2 spot is reserved for those dimwits who think the war on drugs is Constitutional.

First we have Joe Biden, who coined the term 'drug czar,' after watching Reefer Madness and decided that something must be done to warn the nations youth about the dangerous reefer plant.
Then we have Tim Kaine, who recently remarked "I wouldn't vote for a law at the federal or state level that would decriminalize marijuana."

Hillary Clinton, of course, has always been a prohibitionist since that's in the democrat party DNA - the you are not born with rights but rights are granted to you by government.

Speaking of Hillary, did you know she's been for every war since she nagged Bill to bomb Serbia? She even thought Saddam had a nuculur bomb. WASHINGTON (DUH) -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said she is not sorry she voted for a resolution authorizing President Bush to take military action in Iraq despite the recent problems there but she does regret "the way the president used the authority."

Think of all the very worst things that federal government has done during the past few decades and these two clowns would have been in favor of them: Obamacare, the un Constitutional and racist war on drugs, gun control, socialist bailout of Wall Street, Patriot Act, bailout of Detroit, and every war against nations that were never a threat to the USA: Iraq, Syria, Serbia, Yemen, Afghanistan.

If these two get elected I fear for America.

I

What an exceptional tome of modern literature. Certainly one of the all-time greats. I imagine that this will voluntarily become mandatory reading in all future social studies classes. It can sit high on the bookshelf, right next to the other well-known statist classics, such as: "Our Dear Leader", "Divide and Conquer", and, "Cheating is for Winners". And silly me, how could I forget the acclaimed, "101 Re-Education Camp Work Songs".

It failed at that and just made me even surer that she and her evil vp pick are the biggest crooks this country has ever seen. And this is coming from someone who voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary. She screwed him and stole the nomination.

5.0 out of 5 starsFrom a Independent point of view
ByEverett Starkweatheron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
My verified purchase review seems to have been deleted. Rigging the polls, rigging the reviews. Hopefully this recognized for what it is. Unlike most of the reviewers I bought the book and I read it. I have read all that I can find from both political parties and their candidates.

I am an independent. I have opinions and positions that both sides disagree with. In discussions with people they often get confused by my pragmatic (I like to think enlightened) approach to issues, liking it when I agree with them, calling me an idiot when I don't. I am not beholden to anyone, the opinions of my church or anyone else. My vote is not for sale. I am not a one issue voter

So this book provided a useful insight into the thinking of the democratic party.

3.0 out of 5 starsCollection of Talking Points
ByBook SharkTOP 1000 REVIEWERon September 25, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Stronger Together by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tim Kaine
“Stronger Together” is an average collection of talking points that outlines Clinton and Kaine’s campaign plans. Former Secretary of State, Senator, First Lady and attorney Hillary Clinton and former mayor, governor and senator Time Kaine provide the public with an easy to access book on their agenda for the country. This straightforward 288-page book is broken out into four sections: 1. Growing Together, 2. Safer Together, 3. Standing Together, and Working Together.

Positives:
1. Accessible prose for the masses.
2. An important topic, the Democratic Party’s plan for America.
3. Each section is summarized with a “together, we will:”.
4. Brief bios for Clinton and Kaine. “To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.”
5. A look at income inequality. “Income and wealth inequality in America today has reached levels not seen since the 1920s. Corporate executives are making millions while working families are barely scraping by. The very richest Americans—the top one-tenth of 1 percent—now have nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.”
6. Find out what their number one priority is.
7. The importance of infrastructure investment.
8. Accepting the reality of climate change. “To avoid the worst effects of climate change and avoid leaving our children to inherit a planet that is damaged beyond repair, we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and sharply reduce the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.”
9. An important section on how to improve communities left behind.
10. Making college-debt free, an interesting idea.
11. Profit-sharing. “Profit sharing is a win-win.”
12. The reckless behavior on Wall Street that led to the 2008 market crash. “They have tried to hamstring the government’s authority to regulate some of our riskiest financial institutions, and are committed to defunding and defanging the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency dedicated solely to protecting Americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices.”
13. A look at health care. “Insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or charge women higher rates just because of their gender.”
14. Strategy to defeat global terrorism. “Our strategy should have three main elements. One: defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East. Two: disrupt and dismantle the global terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms, and propaganda around the world. Three: harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats.”
15. The need to fix our broken immigration system.
16. A look at our broken criminal system. “Ending the systemic racism that plagues our country—and rebuilding our communities so the police and local communities all see themselves as being on the same side—will require contributions from all of us.”
17. Gun violence always a hot topic. “People on the terror watch list have tried to buy guns more than 2,400 times since 2005—and 90 percent of those purchases were successful. This is because the federal government currently does not prohibit suspected terrorists from buying firearms.”
18. The for equal rights for our LGBT community. “LGBT rights are human rights, and human rights are LGBT rights.”
19. The Supreme Court and the need to overturn Citizens United.
20. Final summaries by Clinton and Kaine.

Negatives:
1. Very poor format. It’s more a talking points style and quite frankly it didn’t work well.
2. Repetitive.
3. Lacks depth.
4. I didn’t like how the book was written, it lacked engagement.
5. On one side, you have a promise to make college debt-free for every American but then it applies to those families with family incomes below $125,000. The buying power of money varies greatly from state to state and within the state.
6. A lot of missed opportunities to make clear the differences between parties. A table showcasing the differences between political parties on key issues would have been welcomed.

In summary, I was a little disappointed in this book. Full disclosure, I’m a progressive-minded citizen and will vote for Hillary Clinton. The book however, was written in a talking-points, repetitive style and missed opportunities to make clear the differences between the political parties. However, the book does cover the main issues albeit in a quick rather general way. Read if you want to have a quick reference on where Clinton/Kaine stand on the main issues. Average book.
Further suggestions: “Hard Choices” by Hillary Clinton, “We’re Still Right, They’re Still Wrong: The Democrats’ Case for 2016 by James Carville, “The Divide” by Matt Taibbi, “A Call to Action” by Jimmy Carter, “Why the Right Went Wrong” by E.J. Dionne, “A Fighting Chance” by Elizabeth Warren, and “American Amnesia” by Jacob S. Hacker.

4.0 out of 5 starsBUY THIS BOOK!
ByAdam Adimenton September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Yet again Hilary fails to deliver the blistering, chafing erotica that a woman married to one of the most prolific crotch-smiths of our time should be delivering at our feet along with maybe a sandwich. She instead delivers a riveting speech you've already heard with some differences. What are the differences you might ask? The basic differences are that she gives us a more detailed print than she was able to read off the teleprompter the first time at the convention and campaign stops where she can't put on her tri-focal glasses cause she wants to look tough and virile like John Wayne in front of all the terrorists that we aren't sure are terrorists yet until we find out exactly why they declared allegiance to ISIS/IS/Daesh/Whatever-we're-calling-it-today. Oh and she has a guy no one has ever heard of with the assuring smile of a Tickle Me Elmo on the side. Kids everywhere can feel safe with a smile like that and a grandma who only coughs up non-contagious never heard of before pneumonia phlegm up onto them. Personally, I'd feel better with her husband who will most likely do something to me I don't want with something that I understand looks like a fish hook or Joshua tree but much like with Juanita Brodderick he'd feel my pain with me afterwards.

Basically, do you want boring talking points phrased differently? Do you want to donate money because you know it's harder for warlords in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to donate cash for her elections on demand? Are you mad at the concept that Bernie Sanders could've legitimately won the election had it not been for the fast thinking Hilary saving you from the peril's of democracy and college students? Are you worried now that Jeffrey Epstein is thrown in jail that Bill might have slightly less chafe inducing erotic memoirs and needs this infusion of cash for research? Then buy this book!

I took off a star because I saw Tim Kaine (he is the guy with the Tickle Me Elmo smile turns out a google search took a long time to pull up this class act and solid conservative catholic) and a man in drag as Hilary on the cover. I can't believe Hilary's great sense of humor allowed such a disrespectful thing to happen. Seriously, she's already shown how hilarious she is opening up a pickle jar to make Jimmy Fallon a sandwich. I've personally covered up both with a trio of pics of Margot Robbie, Daisy Ridley, and Barbara Palvin being allowed into the USA under her new immigration system because that's exactly what all immigrants would be like. People that contribute good looks and lovely smiles. Oh and I put a pick of a bald eagle up looking approvingly.

3.0 out of 5 starsCould be worse, but luckily a number of other books are available which might better suit your individual preferences and ideals
ByAmazon Customeron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I read this book hoping to pick up some tips on how to manipulate national media into covering my musical endeavors with constant and consistently positive coverage. All I wanted was for CNN, MSNBC or even FOX to present my music in a way so as to make the public feel like they have no choice but to either buy my album or a 4 year supply of Trump Steaks, with no middle ground or alternative options. Sadly, I discovered the media reserves such nationally manipulative coverage for high-ranking members of the illuminati, which is now my new goal. The book did teach me how to solicit large donations from foreign entities in exchange for government influence and favors, and I thoroughly enjoyed the section detailing how to hide dark money and avoid paying taxes by utilizing a "non-profit" organization. I found the step-by-step instructions on how to secretly set up a non-secure private e-mail server for my band page unbelievably helpful. Strangely I found pages 61-89 to be entirely missing and I couldn't help but notice the persistent lingering smell of bleach radiating from the part of the book where I expected to find the transcripts from her $225,000 Wall Street speeches. NOTE: I did not buy my copy from Amazon but I can only assume it was printed by some third party with federal immunity after congress officially subpoenaed the book as evidence for review in an ongoing criminal investigation. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to a friend. . It basically pays for itself when you account for all the tax exempt dark money and lobbyist donations you'll be receiving. I would have given it 5 stars if only my band was allowed to participate in the official presidential debates. Legal disclaimer: if you don't buy this book, you are legally obligated to buy Trumps biography.

If you are an open racist with sexiest tendencies and a "YUGE" multi-million dollar inheritance, Trumps biography might be for you. In it, his team of expert authors detail how to incite violence, publicly write off failed business as "winning" and dominate political debates by answering all relevant questions by mercilessly attacking the physical appearance of opponents and moderators. If you've always wondered how to casually pander to your sexist/racist base without establishing any concrete policy proposals, Trumps biography might be for you.

Do you have reoccurring wet dreams of a completely laissez faire free market capitalism void of "business killing" environmental, social and safety regulations? If you spend your free time denying climate change, you should check out the literary work of Gary Johnson. As his policies would make government less influential and overall smaller, his works may also appeal to anarchist as a step toward no government at all.

Alternatively if you object to blindly bombing children and women for the profit of the military industrial complex, you likely have a lot in common with Jill Stein. If you are tired of over 50% of your taxes going to undisclosed military operations while the media continues fear mongering to justify this cost of “defense”, I’d recommend the publications of Jill Stein. She exposes the moral bankruptcy of our current corporate government, and details policies to remedy the situation, such as not being dangerously greedy, not intentionally destroying the planet, feeding people instead of killing them, providing medical care to even the poorest people on the planet so as they may continue living even after falling ill. Her books are also perfect for people who want to buy a book written by a woman but also don’t want that book to symbolically make women everywhere seam like evil lying robot puppets. But if you support the private prison industry and the resulting slave wage labor of American prisoners, you’ll want to steer clear of Jill Stein. Disclaimer: by reading any part of of her written work you will instantly, publicly, and permanently be labeled a conspiracy theorist and added to a number of federal watch list. If you actually purchase any of her publications you will be socially shunned and vocally blamed for single handedly handing the election to Trump or Hillary, whichever is worse.

5.0 out of 5 starsA Blueprint of How We as Americans Will Move our Country Forward Together
ByGregg Chadwickon September 19, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine's book "Stronger Together" begins with a powerful statement: "It has been said that America is great because America is good." Clinton and Kaine agree with that statement as do I. The book continues and reminds us that,"we face our fair share of threats and challenges." The strength of this 249 page volume is the detailed description of policy suggestions that carry the knowledge that the United States is a country of good as it creates positive change for the benefit of all its citizens.

"Stronger Together" outlines investments in job growth, clean energy, debt free college plans, reining in Wall Street, equal pay for women, expanded health coverage, LGBT rights, open internet, expanded K-12 education, fair immigration reform, national defense, women's health and reproductive rights, and more.
.
Hillary writes, "Americans don't say:"I alone can fix it." We say: "We'll fix it together." Clinton and Kaine's book is a blueprint of inspiration and ideas of how we as Americans will move our country forward together. Highly recommended.

1.0 out of 5 starsThe Book or the Movie?
ByK. L. Losemanon October 29, 2016
Format: Paperback
This book is an interesting read. In my opinion, it's even better than the movie version ("Hillary's America"). For those of us that love reading, the book is almost always better than the book but, usually, the book comes out first. .

5.0 out of 5 starsI give 5 stars to reviews written by the people not the book
ByInnaron October 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I give 5 stars to all hilarious and smart reviews written apparently by poorly educated and deplorable Trump supporters. If published they would make a great sequel - "Stronger Together reviewed" by We The People.

Tim Kane named a VP on July 22nd, book gets published on Sep 6. Do they think that people are fools?. Why would anyone buy anything, leave alone cast a vote for these two scammers?

3.0 out of 5 starsNeeded more detail, less fluff, but reasonably sufficient
ByIvy ReisnerVINE VOICEon October 13, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This is, for the most part, what I want to see from the candidates. They state the issue, list the proposed solutions, then go through each solution one at a time in greater detail.

That said, first, I would have liked to see more detail. Yes, they cite substantial references, but I would like to see more specifics. Dropping this program will save money. How much? Over what time period? Adding this program will aid new graduates in starting a small business. How much will it cost? Will that cost continue after three years, or will the "catch up effect" negate it? I'm dinging it one star for being less complete than I would have liked.

I'm also dinging it a star for being repetitive. Certain stock phrases are repeated over and over. For this, the book could have used a better editor.

Overall, a fairly reasonable overview of the policies and reasoning of these candidates.

The book is already being offered 'used' for about $7. If you wait a bit longer, they may just give it away out of the back end of a military plane in Mena, Arkansas.

I enjoy that Hillary supports the LGBT community. I appreciate her wanting to get student loan debt under control and raise minimum wage. I think the US needs to focus more on getting ourselves out of debt before we can help other countries as much as she wants to. I don't think we should be lenient with folks who are incarcerated because of drugs. It's disgusting when people live like that and not nice to have in a society. Also if the minimum wage was raised I think it would be good because some people should be working there instead of in big businesses.

5.0 out of 5 starsBest policy document I've ever read
ByRichard W. Fieldon October 21, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Wow! Policy! Not vague statements of vague ideas that are tailored simply to have some emotional impact, but real policy, laid out in detail as any reasonable voter would want. This book covers the entire course. Domestic and foreign policy. But it gets into the details. Each chapter sets a domain of issues. Then the chapter is broken up into specific goals that Clinton/Caine wish to achieve in that domain. Then the goals are broken down into specifics as to what needs to be done and how it can be done. This is "drilling down" and getting into the details. Hey, if you're electing an executive team it is great to hear in such detail what they want to do.

The full breadth of issues are covered. Employment growth, bringing down college costs, reining in tax avoidance, ISIS and homeland security, energy policy, child care, all are covered and much more.

I have not read the rival book from Donald Trump, "Great Again," but why would I? The product description is an excerpt from the preface, and all that it displays is one-liners. Apparently the author is incapable of putting together coherent paragraphs. I would guess that this probably was written by Trump himself. If he hired someone to write this he was certainly duped out of some money. No, I think it is pure Donald. Gibberish!, which is all that I expect.

5.0 out of 5 starsIdeas From President Hillary Clinton and Vice President Tim Kaine
ByStella Carrieron October 21, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This book Stronger Together by Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine outlines important plans/ideas Clinton and Kaine have for helping millions of people across America as well as global issues. Some of their ideas include revamping public schools across various zipcodes, in order for kids in public schools to have access to a quality curriculum (regardless of their socio-economic status). There are ideas to overhaul and improve on communities hit by manufacturing closures and to implement a new Manufacturing Renaissance Tax Credit. Additional ideas are included on making college more financially in reach for more people. Clinton and Kaine also have a plan to encourage all states to expand Medicaid, in addition to many more plans. On a global scale, Clinton and Kaine have written an objective to strengthen alliances and partnerships abroad, work to maintain them the alliances, as well as more global solutions.

In an election that has been so focused on character, it is important to remember that we're also voting for policies. This book tells you what Clinton and Kaine's are - and is worth a read.

5.0 out of 5 starsBeyond the Headlines - Hillary's Plans
ByShepherdesson October 25, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
This is essential reading for all voters! Cut through the chaos of election year, and find out what Hillary actually is planning to do as president. Whatever your politics are, you probably want information. If you are undecided, you want to know what a vote for Hillary means. If you are a Hillary supporter, then this book will help you talk about Hillary's plans for the future with other people wondering what she would do as president.

I found the book surprisingly informative, well-organized, and easy to read. It has a simple, easy to follow layout, with sections on the economy, security and foreign policy, and domestic policy sub-divided into dozens of shorter sections explaining exactly how she would get things done. Hillary and Kaine start off the book, saying "We have an old-fashioned idea about politics: People who are running to lead the United States of America should tell you what they're going to do, why they're going to do it, and how they're going to get it done." I couldn't agree more, and that is exactly what this book accomplishes, just as the subtitle states, it is a blueprint for a more just and prosperous future with less inequality and more opportunity.

My favorite thing about the book was the level of detail. You have probably heard the headlines and speeches, about how Hillary wants in state college to be free to middle class families, but did you know that she also would allow graduates with student debt to defer payment if they start their own business? Or how she would allow people who have to cut work and stay home to care for an elderly parent, disabled family member, or special needs child, to earn Social Security for their caregiving work. There are so many good ideas here, on an astonishing range of issues, from providing people with skills, but no degree, credentials so they can get better paid work, to expanding insurance coverage for autism services while doing research into the condition to improve the lives of the 3.5 Americans with autism. Many of these plans would affect my life - and the lives of many others - in concrete positive ways. I am impressed to find concern for the bullying that autistic people face side by side with plans to defeat ISIS. The depth and detail of Hillary's plans show how she is well-informed about the challenges ordinary people face and how she would build on three decades of experience as an advocate for human rights and the welfare of the disabled, the disadvantaged, and children.

If you are tired of misinformation, platitudes, vague generalizations, and sweeping statements, pick up this book and read about Hillary's ambitious progressive goals in her own words.

5.0 out of 5 starsAn ACTUAL review of the ACTUAL book
ByAlexon November 1, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
This review will purposefully avoid all political commentary and focus solely on the content of the book and its structure. If you're looking for criticism or praise of Secretary Clinton, I'm sure you can find a thousand more useful locations than the review section of Amazon.com.

If you are interested in reading the platform of Secretary Clinton and Governor Kaine, this book, "Stronger Together", is the way to go. The bulk of the text is divided into three sections, each describing in detail her policy proposals and their justifications for the economy, national security, and domestic affairs. Within each section, the campaign details several large policy goals. By way of example, in the economy section, "Expand health coverage and tackle mental health, addiction, and Alzheimer's disease" is listed as an over-arching policy goal. When the book reaches that section, it dives deeper and becomes more specific. It lists several more detailed policies specific to that overarching theme. For example, "Prevent, effectively treat, and make an Alzheimer's cure possible by 2025." Then the book will expand on each of those proposals by detailing four or five proposals to accomplish that goal. It gives examples of bills to propose, executive orders to write, taxes to be repealed or levied, commissions to be formed, public-private partnerships to be cultivated, et cetera. So, the structure of the book is basically a giant outline like one might make in the fifth grade, following an I:A:i:a:1 format, where each level down becomes more specific.

If you are a wonk, or looking for specificity, then book has great value. While it contains the obvious high-flying rhetoric here and there and includes a few excerpts from campaign speeches and talking points, the vast majority of the book is made up of facts, figures, and policy proposals. I find this interesting - a have a law degree and a masters in political science, so that stuff if right up my alley. But I can certainly see how one might find that boring or too "in the weeds" if you were looking for a more traditional read. I personally believe all candidates for all offices should release something like this book so we can get specifics on their platforms, and I appreciate the straightforward approach this book takes. It's well worth the read.

I am a registered Republican. I have an open mind. I like to hear what the candidates will do for the American public if they are elected. This book, and the book written by Donald Trump, has helped me immensely. I am also going to use the internet to learn what Mr. Johnson and Miss Stein will do for the American public if they are elected.

The reason I gave this book only three stars is because there is a lot of repetition in it. This book provides more information than all of the televised debates combined.

ByNorth Carolinaon October 25, 2016

Refreshing to have a candidate spell out their plans. Some candidates plans are 'Trust Me'. As Ronald Reagan would say - Trust but Verify. This book verifies that Clinton and Kaine have thought through the issues facing our country. Seem to recall many saying the world would come to an end if Barack Obama became President. President Obama has done well and Hillary Clinton is very well prepared to do the same. Would suggest that folks actually read this book before writing a review. Hillary Clinton has the experience and temperament to be a great President - she has my vote (literally, as I have just voted early here in NC)

Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
There are now just 3 days before the election. The Most Important Election of Our Lifetime For Most. I highly recommend that everyone buy/read this book STRONGER TOGETHER by Hillary & Tim & then GO VOTE for Hillary. Hillary is the only candidate who has the solutions our " starving " country craves. When Hillary gives a speech, as only Hillary can do, she explains to her listeners her various plans in depth & detail. Hillary connects to people talking about: National Security/ Jobs, focus on keeping jobs in USA,USA made products, Equal Rights, women/LGBT/Everyone, families, Health Care, Mental Health w/priority focus on Suicide Awareness/Prevention, military/vets, families, immigration reform with path to citizenship, free college, student loans, Criminal Justice Reform, bridging the gap between law enforcement & communities, restoring voting rights, Climate Change/Clean Energy jobs/ common sense gun operation while respecting the 2nd Amendment. Hillary has yrs. of experience, multiple accomplishments such as increasing the death benefit military families received from $12,000 to $100,000. Hillary was the Junior Senator who saw to it that our 9/11 first responders were able to receive the immediate medical care/services they needed after the tragedy. On the international front : Hillary successfully negotiated a ceasefire between Israel & Hamas. Hillary must be our 45th President & just as Importantly Hillary must lead our country as Commander-In-Chief. I want Hillary making those moment-by-moment National Security decisions that require experience, knowledge, steadiness, judgment of someone who has operated in the Situation Room. Hillary operated in the Situation Room when seconds counted. I TRUST Hillary to make those decisions. Vote Hillary for our President & Commander-In-Chief 2016.

ByHope for the Beston October 24, 2016
Format: Paperback
Well written, detailed, enlightening, and inspiring. This is literally a blueprint for the future of our country and explains the policies and proposals the Secretary Clinton has made the foundation of her campaign platform. All candidates should provide such information so voters can make more educated choices when selecting a president. Not sure what the negative reviews are all about but this is a must read for anyone who takes this election seriously and wants to make a good decision regarding our republic.

BySouper Daveon October 24, 2016

Great book. This is where America is headed, like it or not. Don't listen to the trumpets. They'll be gone soon enough. After the election, we will just ignore them while we are getting things done. I'm sure they'll have fun watching sitting on their lazy asses, drinking the Bud Light & snacking on nacho "cheese". Donald Trump actually did us a favor; Now, we know who all the stupid people are. Very handy!

5.0 out of 5 starsLove The Ideas In This Book!
ByTeresa Peterson October 15, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I am amazed and thrilled that the ideals I have are discussed in this book. In our world there is so much negativity towards Hillary Clinton. This book written by Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine shows us the true Hillary Clinton. This book is great for every American to read. To vote we must be informed. I love the goals and ideas in this book. In the beginning Hillary says we need more love and kindness along with action to solve our problems. Yes! They both say they can't do this alone. With the help of the American people they can solve America's problems. I plan on being involved. All of America needs to wake up and get involved and give our support to heal our huge problems.

ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016

I thought the book was very thought provoking. It gives a greater insight into the making of the political system and the duties performed by those elected officials placed in a position to make a difference. I saw a number of negative reviews, however, I do not believe that most of the people who reviewed the book actually read it. It they did, I do not feel they could come up with a 1 sate rating. What are they basing that one?
It is a book worth reading and I found it highly informative

5.0 out of 5 starsA veteran spreaks out
ByPatriot Fanon October 13, 2016

A thoroughly honest and enjoyable book. Hillary takes the time to explain her logical plans to keep America great. Unlike her opponent, she does not subscribe to the adage that the best defense is a good offense. I am a Gulf War veteran, parent of an autistic child, college educated woman. Paranoia, threats, and accusations that we have heard from Trump indicates a mental illness. A person of his character would be dangerous to our country and society.

5.0 out of 5 starsSuccinct and Incisive!
ByOld movie fanon September 27, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
After ferreting a synopsis of the Clinton/Kaine Platform on the Internet I discovered that I still had additional questions that were not addressed on the sites I consulted. More specifically, I wanted additional information on a solution to student debt which is an enormous task. (I attended university in an era when student tuition at a public university was $180 a semester!) A repeal of the Citizens United decision is also an imperative. A massive new investment in infrastructure to alleviate the "infrastructure gap" is also in the cards! I was impressed with the description of how this investment would grow the local economy at the same time. There are many many other proposals that will help restore the America that I grew up in!

5.0 out of 5 starsAMERICAN VALUES OF PROGRESS TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD
ByJameson October 8, 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
It's too bad that people can't be open to ideas different from themselves. Are they scared that their head would explode? Or maybe they may learn something new and change. The idea that corporations have too much influence in our government is finally in the hands of someone who can do something about it. She is focused on key problems around education that lead to so many of our challenges. What I read in this book was more content around a plan to engage government in fixing problems to help us move forward. This book spoke to me personally and to the challenges I see in the world. If we could all get involved beyond just our vote then we could likely come together and solve more challenges. She asked for input and I want to do more to share ideas and take action. This isn't something we should leave to our politicians to handle alone. We are needed to get involved. This book helped me understand how I can make a difference.

I posted this and in less than a day I have been asked to go become a target of violence in the desert. This comment by Robert Williams I have reported to Amazon because this is not the type of discourse that should be had on Amazon or between Americans. We can disagree but to recommend I go die that is a truly low response. Mr. Williams needs to take a look at who he is as a person because what I am seeing is deplorable.

5.0 out of 5 starsCheck It Out: A REAL Review!
ByDavidon September 30, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Weird! Almost no one reviewing this book has read a single page. A rabid army of Hillary-haters organized to flood Amazon with thousands of bogus reviews where they dump on their favorite arch-enemy. Oddly, a good number of them are so confused or ill-informed they think five stars means execrable. Having said that, some of these fake reviews are actually quite funny!

I paid for this book and read it all the way through. So here’s my real review. Clinton and Kaine have outlined a fairly detailed, sometimes idealistic but centrist plan to keep America’s modest recovery going. It is entirely mainstream, pushing for a balanced foreign policy, strongly supportive of cops, demanding excellence of our kids in schools. It’s not a hysterical rant by any means, and both of these public servants have the established resumés and research teams to buttress their proposals.

If resentful people want to spend their time zit-exploding their frustrations in this ill-mannered torrent, I guess they’re entirely welcome to do so. I can pretty much guarantee they’re going to be badly disillusioned when their hero is crushed on Election Day.

I'm glad to be reading Stronger Together. It is an ambitious agenda and could be criticized for side stepping the difficult steps of funding etc. But there is a lot here; and I am often interested to see recognition of the compromises at stake between two conflicting goals-- for example, that between Security and Civil Liberties. But I value this read. I am also one who believes Hillary is a gifted and dedicated leader.

This was an exhausting book to read. I usually read mysteries and detective books where there is an eventual climax. This book is obviously just an introduction to what can be.

We cannot let him be in this most powerful position of President of these United States of America.

I've read the book and appreciate the hard work they spent in penning this piece. I share their vision to bring society together as a whole. We can't change this nation without changing the minds of others.

Its extremely unfortunate and frustrating that there are a great deal of folks coming on here that obviously are Trump supporters to degrade Hillary and haven't read the book. This is why those comments are being deleted. It isn't that she has fans at Amazon as much as it is as mean people spreading hate.

ByAmazon Customeron September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
It takes a lot of effort for a candidate to write a book in a short time that provides a brief, understandable outline of what they stand for. I ordered this book as I do with all books from candidates and began reading it immediately. It's broken down by chapters of issues and addresses them in an easy-to-understand way. For anyone who wants to make a smart vote, read about ALL candidates and what their positions are on issues.
I was disappointed to see so many negative "reviews" - which appear to be faked from people who didn't even bother to read the book - that just shows ignorance. Be smart, and learn. This was a valiant effort on behalf of the campaign to inform people.

4.0 out of 5 starsDeserves Serious Consideration
ByS.Dobbson September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I don't see a single substantive review here. I don't believe any of the negative reviewers have actually purchased or read this book. If you came to this page only to spew hatred and prejudice your comments belong in the trash. The comments are childish. GROW UP. There's some serious cognitive dissonance among the GOP candidate's followers who can't see his severe limitations and major character flaws but who obsess over whatever they perceive as Clinton's flaws. Spewing whatever is on his mind (no matter how ignorant or vile) doesn't make Trump an honest person. Nor does Clinton's self discipline and self control show she is dishonest.

It's a shame that at the time I'm writing this 85% of reviewers couldn't even speak to the contents of the book. They'd rather talk about an Email scandal that has no bearing on the book.

5.0 out of 5 starsRight Wing Political Agenda Behind Flood of Negative Reviews
ByD. L. Loveon September 26, 2016
Format: Paperback
Right wingers have for years been engaged in flooding non-conservative books with negative reviews. So this sudden deluge of very negative reviews of this book should be regarded with suspicion. I know I couldn't subscribe to any ideology that I had to justify my belief it by engaging in deception. I always tell my kids, if you have to lie to conceal reality, that tells you whether or not whether what you're doing is good or bad. The problem with rabid political ideology is it becomes your mind. You no longer think, you just consult the pre-fabricated ideology to tell you what you're supposed to think. That's too much trust in some nameless powerful entity orchestrating the ideology. How do you know THEIR intentions are good? Because you're being told everything you want to hear? Child killers tell kids they have candy. You're supposed to have sense enough not to take bait like that. This country is a mess because of hyper-partisanship. People forfeiting reason and dominion of their their own judgement of right vs. wrong, in favor of fervent adherence to think tank- manufactured political narratives. If you've been reduced to participating i political deception so that your side can "win", you're selling your soul. For what? Politics? Some member of the ruling elite's promise that the world will be exactly as you want it? Child, no political party is going to fix your life. Change everything!!! Your experience is a result of YOUR disposition and the energy YOU resonate with . If your energy is perpetually negative because you're being consistently urged to hate this group or that group, darling, nothing external is going to help you. Your problems are form WITHIN. There is no flag, no national anthem, no skin color, no religion, no political party that possesses the power to fix YOU.

ByObserveron September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
What a great book. It takes such a positive tone about what is right with this country and what needs work, but is doable. It shows us how to achieve the positive change we need. Only negative haters would find anything to criticize. Sure, some would have a difference of opinion, but only deeply negative trolls would totally melt down reading it. They will make great team in the White House. This book is only the start to show how they approach important matters, and how they will lead us all there.

I've enjoyed reading and I'm happy to own (for $5! - reasonable) a piece of history. I think people of any political persuasion owe it to themselves, in the interest of being informed, to read this and understand what the candidates have to say for themselves, instead of through the filter of our various news outlets and stranger-yet online "news" outlets.

5.0 out of 5 starsMy daughter who is 21 now understands what her future will be like under a Clinton/Kaine presidency
ByCharlene Montgomeryon September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I found that the sound bites were not enough during the early debates with Mr. Sanders, and with all the rhetoric being thrown around in the media, I wasn't able to get a gist of what Mrs. Clinton was proposing. Reading this book on how she and Mr. Kaine have actual plans and ways to implement them, really motivated me. I was always going to vote for Mrs. Clinton's agenda, but now I have to get other's motivated to join the fight. My daughter who is 21 now understands what her future will be like under a Clinton/Kaine presidency. To my surprise, she is even getting her friends engaged. Thanks for the in-depth picture into your policies.

By80 year old jazz loveron September 17, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
With the assistance of the sound bites of TV and social media Donal Trump has been able to flumox the Republican Party, and con the general public. It may be good or bad, but it’s all entertainment! Printed substantive words, especially positive words, have a much smaller audience, but are still very important.
Pro Trump people can’t risk having the public read Hillary Clinton’s “Stronger Together” book, so they corrupt Amazon’s Book Review option with phoney negative reviews designed to discourage its purchase, and, so far get away with it. The loser is, not only the public, but Amazon’s reputation. I have alerted Amazon, and the one * negative reviews have been reduced, but the pro Trump people have even corrupted some of the the five *****, supposedly positive reviews!!! The price of freedom is vigilance; something Germany forgot, pre Hitler. I pray America remembers!

If you don't know Hillary Clinton or understand her policies, I strongly suggest you read this book. If you know her policies only through Fox News, then at least see what she has to say uncut and uncensored. I believe her to be a great woman, as vulnerable and prone to mistakes as all of us, but with the education and experience needed to lead our country hand in hand with all Americans. Her book spells out her policies.

From the economy, security and even the domestic policy was very enlightening and even more educational than one could imagine. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, I give praise to them for taking time out of their busy schedule to put this Blueprint for America's Future book together. I'm from the SHOW ME STATE and you did just that! Action speaks better than words. Plus thanks for making it affordable! This is what leadership looks like, Knowing the Laws and being able to put it in a book form instead of a teleprompter. It should be a best seller!!

Kudos to the candidates for providing an easy-to-read, layperson-friendly outline and description of the proposals for change which they've designed to help working Americans. This book builds on the website information, making it possible to be better informed for voting in November. I wish more candidates would do this, especially for major offices. They address major issues inclusive of jobs, the economy in general, debt-free college, company profit-sharing, taxing on Wall Street and the super-wealthy, support for Social Security, defeating ISIS, supporting the military, childhood education, immigration, criminal justice system, environmental protections, and equal rights. Further, each candidate has included a short article that explains a key point of their personal political philosophy.

The choices in the 2016 Election Year have never been clearer. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have outlined a very extensive agenda that will help make a 'Great America' even more accessible to all citizens. Getting these programs into law may be a bigger problem with the Congress mired in gridlock and obstructionism. It would be great if the new Congress learned to compromise and show some political courage.

5.0 out of 5 starsActions speak louder than words-everybody deserves a second chance
ByAztlanon September 15, 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I am glad Mrs. Clinton wrote a book with her thoughts, that can always be reviewed and revised, with the appropriate people if she wins;
this will allowed people to make her accountable if she doesn't keep her promises.
I have learned she has made mistakes, she has recognized them, and apologized for it.
She has been providing much more information than her opponent, however, people do not give her any credit nor the benefit of the doubt.
It is very sad people can't see the enormous danger her opponent represents, he has all the components to be a great dictator.
I was wondering why people can't see he has no respect for many values and morals of this country, so what makes them think he will respect the constitution once he has the power? I like history a lot, and I have studied about president Kennedy, he never talked about himself, he was all about what we can do for our country. I am sorry but to me that is a leader, not a narcissist talking about how good he is, kind of superman........., but even the character superman, has been all about to help people, not about himself. Hillary' opponent loves himself and nothing else. In my particular case I can't support somebody that has been cheating, and taking advantage of people to his benefit. I have worked in supply chain for 30 years,
and dealing with many suppliers and contractors, I always looked for the benefit of the company I worked for, but never trying to take advantage of the people doing services for my employer. I can't support somebody with no ethics, with double standard, and definitely I will no give the opportunity for that person to get even much more power.
What happened with the country that used to say " United we Stand " after 09/11?, that was a very painful tragedy for the US, but it was so nice to see people with solidarity, caring for each other, no ethnicities, no colors, were important. The goal was to be together and work as a team, to get up again and move forward, that is how winning is done. This is a beautiful country, I am hoping we can work together again, respecting each other, instead divisions between us. Union make force, and "we the people" need to be united to make improvements and get fixed what we do not like. I believe much better results can be obtained. Thank you for your time.

Really inspiring and hopeful. So nice to get a more detailed look at how she wants to govern & her outlook on the world and the future. It's easy to see that the future POTUS & VP, have taken their life experience from childhood to formulate their perspective on their careers of service. I look forward to seeing how they will forge forward & hope they will rise to the task of the office which they seek as they will be held accountable. So refreshing to have a positive perspective rather than the doom, gloom & despair espoused by the other side.

This is a very nice overview of the Clinton/Kaine ticket plans and policies. Easy readying, but also crystal clear about what Clinton and Kaine tend to do and what values they stand for. We all need to fully understand who the next President and Vice President are. I am impressed with the honesty and clarity in their expressed views, which are so very different from their opponents' who seem to pivot about something every week. This was an educational and reassuring read.

I approve of Hillary's agenda, though not all of it, not as much as Bernie's, but at least it's 100x better than Trump's.

The competitor's book is called "Trump: Divided We Fall" and it is about the art of spectacle and how it distracts from real discourse on policy. I wouldn't recommend it but I think the title is right on. Go Hillary!

5.0 out of 5 starsAttack of the trolls...
ByJimon September 25, 2016
Format: Paperback
I don't generally read books like this, but the controversy over the the right trolls caught my attention. Anyone reading their reviews should remember that none of them have actually read the book. How do I know? For one thing, they are mostly illiterate and the book has neither pictures nor pop ups. It is also written on at least an 8th grade level, far above their reading level. Such a book would hold little interest for them in any case. It does not contain any racism, sexism, misogyny, or homophobia, which forms the basis of their world view.

My advice to them would be to perhaps try reading the job notices on Monster.com. Employmemt would give them somethimg constructive to do and save tax dollars which are being wasted on their welfare payments.

Hilary Clinton,

You are going to be the next President of the United States. Do not let this mass of trolls and mostly uneducated people take you down. The top ceiling is waiting to be broken and it will. I pray for people who cannot see the harm they are doing to themselves and the disservice they are doing to their children. You are an extremely educated women and that makes many people nervous. You extremely prepared for this big job and I know you will do it with all your heart and intellect. God Bless you and Mr. Kaine.!!!!!!

Real plans to keep America moving forward. Sad that Trump fans use these reviews as a vehicle to express their hate.

The hate-mongers are here in force. I wish The Donald had such a book about his plans. It would have to be titled
"Hate, Racism, Bigotry, Misogyny; How to Divide the American People and Destroy the American Image in the World."
